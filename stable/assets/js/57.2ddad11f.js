Or perhaps a hyperlink is provided or an attachment, which opens a program using a lookup table of which the program is the default for handling a certain file extension. The application framework attempts to solve this problem by creating structured messages that can be sent from one application plug-in to another. An application plug-in has a context of the information that it contains. You can use this context to invoke an action on another application plug-in that is better suited to handle some of the information discovered in the first application plug-in. Well-structured messages facilitate knowing what application plug-in is "right" to handle a situation, and explain in detail what that application plug-in should do. This way, rather than finding out that the attachment with the extension ".dat" was not meant for a text editor, but instead for an email client, one application plug-in might instead be able to invoke an action on an application plug-in, which can handle opening of an email for the purpose of forwarding to others (a more specific task than can be explained with filename extensions).')]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"actions"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#actions"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Actions")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("To manage communication from one application plug-in to another, a specific structure is needed.
