## Understanding the doc branches

Before you get started with the authoring work, it's necessary that you understand the different branches to work on.
* **[`master`](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/tree/master/docs)** -  protected branch

  Docs for [https://docs.zowe.org/stable](https://docs.zowe.org/stable). This branch contains the most recent stable release content.

* **[`docs-staging`](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/tree/docs-staging/docs)** - protected branch

  Docs for the upcoming `vNext` release. When Zowe has a release, its `docs-staging` branch will be merged into `master` and the content will be visible on [https://docs.zowe.org/stable](https://docs.zowe.org/stable).

* (REMOVED TEMPORARILY UNTIL NEW COMPONENT FEATURES ARE AVAILABLE) **[`active-development`](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/tree/active-development/docs)** - protected branch

  Docs for a forward-version that includes features not yet included in the Zowe Stable version. Its content is published on [https://docs.zowe.org/active-development](https://docs.zowe.org/active-development) for early validation purpose.

* **`v<v.r>.x`** - protected branches

  Docs for an archived version, where `v` indicates the version, `r` indicates the release number. For example, `v1.0.x`, `v1.1.x`, `v1.6.x`.

* Branches that start with `release-` contain archived patch release documentation for historical tracking.
* You can have your own personal branch to work on content for a certain issue or feature. However, be sure to check and remove unused personal branches periodically for easy maintenance. Usually when your branch is merged, you can safely delete it.

## Understanding doc site organization and files

<!--
The `docs/.vuepress` folder defines the site organization, style and table of contents. The following files are important.

- **pages.json**: Defines the high level doc site architecture, including the nav bar (top navigation) and the side bar (left-hand navigation). If you have a new file to add to the site, modify this file.

- **versions.json**: Controls the **Version** drop down list on the doc site. When there is a new version to publish, modify this file to add a new entry.

- **config.js**: Defines the doc site configuration, such as the version number, the theme, and the Edit in GitHub links.

- **/public**: Contains public assets and files for download.

The `docs/README.md` contains content for the homepage of the doc site.
-->

- `/docs/` - Contains the Markdown files for the docs. Customize the order of the docs sidebar in `sidebars.js`. 
- `/docusaurus.config.js` - A config file containing the site configuration.
- `/sidebar.js` - Specify the order of documents in the sidebar. If you have a new file to add to the site, modify this file.
- `/src/` - Non-documentation files like pages or custom React components.
  - `/src/pages` - Any files within this directory will be converted into a website page.
- `/static/` - Static directory. Any contents inside here will be copied into the root of the final `build` directory.
- `/package.json` - A Docusaurus website is a React app. You can install and use any npm packages you like in them.

## Adding DCO signoff to commits

Zowe requires the use of the Developer’s Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO). Every commit to this repo and other Zowe repos should be signed off using DCO. Otherwise, the PR could not be merged.

To sign off a commit, add a Signed-off-by line to your commit message. For example, `Signed-off-by: John Doe john.doe@hisdomain.com`.

### Tools for automatic DCO signoff

If you don't want to manually copy/paste your signature in every commit, use one or both of the following tools:

- To enable auto-signoff for local commits, download and enable the [DCO signoff tool](https://github.com/coderanger/dco) on your PC. This method works when committing via command-line or Github Desktop.

    **Tip:** To enable the tool, issue the `dco enable` on each new repository that you clone.

- **(Google Chrome)** To enable auto-signoff for commits made through the GitHub Web UI, install [DCO GitHub UI](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dco-github-ui/onhgmjhnaeipfgacbglaphlmllkpoijo?hl=en) in your browser.

### What to do if I missed DCO signoff in previous commits?

If you missed DCO sign-off statements in a series of commits, you can retroactively sign commits by following these steps:

1. Check and review all commits that report missing DCO signoff. If you already opened a PR, you can find this information by clicking the **Details** link in the DCO check entry.
2. Create a new text (.txt) file (suggested name is `past_commits_<your name>.txt`) within the `doc_signoffs` folder.
3. Add the following contents to the file. Take a look at [this folder](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/tree/master/dco_signoffs) for examples.

    ```
    I, <author_name> hereby sign-off-by all of my past commits to this repo subject to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO), Version 1.1. In the past I have used emails: <emails>
    <COMMIT HASH> <COMMIT MSG>
    ```

4. Commit this file to the doc site. Remember to include the signoff line in the commit message as well.

## Building the docs

### Previewing or testing the doc site locally

#### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version >= 12.13.0 or above (which can be checked by running `node -v`). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) version >= 1.5 (which can be checked by running `yarn --version`). Yarn is a performant package manager for JavaScript and replaces the `npm` client. It is not strictly necessary but highly encouraged.

#### Procedure

If you do not already have the docs site repository set up locally:

1. In your local command line interface, navigate to the directory in which you want to create your local copy of the docs site repository.
1. Clone the docs site repository by running the following command: `git clone https://github.com/zowe/docs-site`
1. Access the newly-cloned repository by changing directories into it: `cd docs-site`

Once you have the docs site repository set up locally and are in the `docs-site` directory, you can build and run the docs site locally by following the steps below:

1. Run the command to install project dependencies: `npm install`
1. Run `npm start`
1. Once complete, you can preview the site locally at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). Every time you modify and save a documentation change, the preview build will be triggered automatically, and then you can refresh your browser to see the changes.


<!-->
#### Errors when running the site locally?

- Stop (CMD + Z) and rerun start script `npm run docs:dev`
- If still errors persist, look for '<' in problem file not wrapped in code syntax.
   - Issues with files can be found at the top of red error text.
- Look for images that are being called but do not exist in the file system.
- If you encounter `JavaScript heap out of memory` error with the build command, it could be caused by `max_old_space_size` being too small. Try to define environment variable `NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096`, or even higher with `NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=8192`. You can define this in the command line with one of the following commands, depending on your operating system:

  - Windows: `set NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192"`
  - Linux/Mac: `export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192"`
-->


### Building the docs for production

You can build the docs with this command:

```
npm run docs:build
```

All build results will be put under the `.deploy` folder. If you didn't configure special variables for the build, the above command will generate HTML pages and put into `.deploy/stable/` folder.

You can check the generated result and verify the content. You can also host the content in `.deploy` and view the result in browser. The below shows how to start the web server with Docker:

```
docker run --name docs-site-test -p 8080:80 -v $PWD/.deploy:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro --rm nginx
```

Now you are able to visit `http://localhost:8080/stable/` to check the content.

<!-->
### Testing broken links

You will need `Docker` to run broken links test. Check https://www.docker.com/get-started to install Docker.

After you build the documentation described above, you can run broken links test with this command:

```
npm run test:links:stable
```

Check `Warning of broken links and other issues (source target lines code fragments):` sections for warnings, and Check `Errors of broken links and other issues (source target lines code fragments):` sections for errors.

Errors must be fixed before merge to the `master` branch, otherwise the pull request will be blocked.

_Please note, if we have multiple documentation versions in place, you may see broken links warnings on links to other versions._

### Understanding the link check warning / error message

If you don't see a section of `Error(s) of broken links and other issues` in the job console log, that means you are all good to go! However, there may be a `Warning(s) of broken links and other issues` which includes warnings but it won't fail the build pipeline. The `(source target lines code fragments)` indicates the fields of each warning / error message.

A typical link check *warning* message may look like this:

```
=================================================================================
Warning(s) of broken links and other issues (source target lines code fragments):
- - http://zowe-docs-test-links/v0-9-x/user-guide/cli-installcli.html http://zowe-docs-test-links/v0-9-x/user-guide/cli-usingcli.html "26, 29, 34" "200 OK" "#displaying-zowe-cli-help,#accessing-an-api-mediation-layer"
- http://zowe-docs-test-links/stable/extend/extend-apiml/api-mediation-onboard-an-existing-java-rest-api-service-without-spring-boot-with-zowe-api-mediation-layer.html http://zowe-docs-test-links/stable/extend/extend-apiml/api-mediation-onboard-an-existing-java-rest-api-service-without-spring-boot-with-zowe-api-mediation-layer.html "24" "200 OK" "#add-context-listener"

- http://zowe-docs-test-links/stable/user-guide/systemrequirements.html http://zowe-docs-test-links/stable/user-guide/systemrequirements.html "24" "200 OK" "#zosmf-configuration"
Total 5 warning(s).
```

A typical link check *error* message may look like this:

```
===============================================================================
Error(s) of broken links and other issues (source target lines code fragments):
- http://zowe-docs-test-links/stable/ https://docs.zowe.org/stable/Zowe_Documentation_1.0.0.pdf "26" "404 Not Found" "-"
- http://zowe-docs-test-links/stable/ http://zowe-docs-test-links/stable/... "26" "404 Not Found" "-"
Total 2 error(s).
```

The above warning / error message includes several informations:

- There are 5 warnings found in the docs build result.
- There are 2 errors found in the docs build result.
- Each line starts with `-` is one particular warning / error.
- Each warning / error line includes 5 fields:
  * source
  * target
  * lines, separated by comma (,)
  * code
  * fragments, separated by comma (,)
- For a line like `- http://zowe-docs-test-links/v0-9-x/user-guide/cli-installcli.html http://zowe-docs-test-links/v0-9-x/user-guide/cli-usingcli.html "26, 29, 34" "200 OK" "#displaying-zowe-cli-help,#accessing-an-api-mediation-layer"`, it means:
  * **source**: in page `/v0-9-x/user-guide/cli-installcli.html`,
  * **targe**: has a link to `/v0-9-x/user-guide/cli-usingcli.html`, which is itself,
  * **lines**: at line `26, 29, 34`, which is 3 lines,
  * **code**: received code `200 OK`, which means retrieving target link is successful,
  * **fragments**: however it failed to find 2 target fragments `#displaying-zowe-cli-help,#accessing-an-api-mediation-layer` in the target html page.
- For line `http://zowe-docs-test-links/stable/ https://docs.zowe.org/stable/Zowe_Documentation_1.0.0.pdf "26" "404 Not Found" "-"`, it means:
  * **source**: in page `/stable/`,
  * **targe**: has a link to `https://docs.zowe.org/stable/Zowe_Documentation_1.0.0.pdf`,
  * **lines**: at line `26`,
  * **code**: received error code `404 Not Found`,
  * **fragments**: without fragments defined.

### Previewing the docs in PDF format

You can build the doc site into a PDF document to preview locally. Launch the build script with command `npm run docs:pdf`. The build result will be put into the `.deploy/.pdf/out` folder if there are no errors.

To update what should be included in PDF document, go ahead edit `docs/.vuepress/config.js ALL_PAGES` property.

Check [Build PDF](docs/.pdf/README.md) for detailed explanations.

For published docs, PDFs of different versions are available for download on the doc site homepage.

## Archiving the docs and creating a new version
