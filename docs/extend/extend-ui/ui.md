# Introduction

This style guide is the visual language that represents Zowe. It is a living document that will be updated based on the needs of our users and software requirements.

## Clear
Our users rely on our software to help them be efficient in their work. The interfaces and experiences we design should be clear so there is never any confusion about where users should click or how to take the next step. Users should always feel confident in their actions.

# Consistent
Users should be able to look at Zowe software products and know they are in a family. Each software product is different but should use similar patterns, icons, and interactions. If a user is switching to a new product within Zowe it should feel familiar.

# Smart
Our users are smart and they need smart software. Zowe design patterns should always compliment the user’s intelligence and reflect the user’s complex work environment. Designs should align with Zowe's Design Language by putting the human needs of the user first.
