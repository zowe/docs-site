# Zowe Conformance Program

## Introduction

Administered by the Open Mainframe Project, the Zowe Conformance Program aims to give users the confidence that when they use a product, app, or distribution that leverages Zowe, they can expect a high level of common functionality, interoperability, and user experience.  

Conformance provides Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), System Integrators (SIs), and end users greater confidence that their software will behave as expected. Just like Zowe, the Zowe Conformance Program will continue to evolve and is being developed by committers and contributors in the Zowe community.

As vendors, you are invited to submit conformance testing results for review and approval by the Open Mainframe Project. If your company provides software based on Zowe, you are encouraged to get certified today.
