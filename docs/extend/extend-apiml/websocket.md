# Using WebSocket support in API Gateway

The API Gateway includes a basic WebSocket proxy which enables the Gateway to access applications that use the WebSocket protocol together with a web UI and a REST API.

The service defines which WebSocket endpoints are exposed by using Eureka metadata.

**Example:**
```
eureka:
    instance:
        metadata-map:
            apiml:
                routes:
                    ws_v1:
                        gatewayUrl: "ws/v1"
                        serviceUrl: /${serviceId}/ws
```

These metadata make it possible for requests from `wss://gatewayHost:gatewayPort/${serviceId}/ws/v1/path` to map to `wss://serviceHost:servicePort/${serviceId}/ws/v1/path`.

* **`serviceId`**  
  Specifies the service ID of the service.
  
* **`path`**  
  Specifies the remaining path segment in the URL.
