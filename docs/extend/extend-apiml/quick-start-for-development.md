# Quick Start for Development

To validate that a service is working properly with the API Mediation Layer, you first need to have a running instance of API Mediation Layer. Choose from the following options: 

- Install Zowe and validate against a Zowe instance of API Mediation Layer
  - For this setup you can either run Zowe without certificates, or preferably with certificates generated by installation in the keystore.
- Run API Mediation Layer in Codespace or on a local machine directly.
  - The details are available in [API Mediation Layer repository](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/)
- Run API Mediation Layer in containers. 
  - The details are available in [Docker for API Mediation Layer](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/tree/v3.x.x/docker)
- Run API Mediation Layer as Java services on z/OS.
  - This part is not documented but is possible. You would need to build the services first, then upload them to the mainframe  

To learn more about the certificate setup options for API Mediation Layer with respect to the Development purposes consult [Certificate Management in Zowe API Mediation Layer](./certificate-management-in-zowe-apiml.md).
