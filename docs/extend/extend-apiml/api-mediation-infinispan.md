# Using Infinispan as a storage solution through the Caching Service

:::info Required roles: system administrator, security administrator

You can configure Infinispan as a storage solution through the Caching Service, as well as configure Infinispan for high availability (HA) to replicate data to provide data durability and availability.

## Understanding Infinispan

Infinispan is a storage solution that stores data structures in key-value pairs. The API Caching Service uses hash sets, where each
service storing data via the Caching Service has its own hash, and each data entry is a key-value entry within that service's Infinispan hash set.

For more information on Infinispan, see the [official Infinispan documentation](https://infinispan.org/documentation/).

### Infinispan replica instances

Infinispan can be used with both a standalone instance and high availability mode. When using multiple Caching Service instances, 
it is necessary to specify all of the cluster nodes (members). Each Infinispan node is bound to a specific Caching Service instance and runs on a different port and host, which can be configured. For more information about configuring multiple Infinispan modes, see the [Infinispan configuration](#infinispan-configuration). 

For more information on Infinispan replication and how to configure a replica instance, see the [Infinispan Cross-site Replication](https://infinispan.org/docs/stable/titles/xsite/xsite.html) documentation.

## Infinispan configuration

Configure Infinispan as a storage solution through the Caching Service by setting the following configuration parameters in the `zowe.yaml`.
 
* **`components.caching-service.storage.infinispan.initialHosts`**

  This property specifies the list of cluster nodes (members). In case of multiple instances, the value for each Caching Service instance can be 
  either a list of all the members, separated by a comma, or just the replica. The format is `${haInstance.hostname}[${components.caching-service.storage.infinispan.jgroups.port}]`.

* **`components.caching-service.storage.infinispan.persistence.dataLocation`**

  The path where the service keeps its data files for the Infinispan Soft-Index Cache Store. 
  The default value is `data`. To run the Caching Service in HA, ensure that you apply the following configuration conditions:

  - The value should be the same for each instance.
  - The location should point to a non-shared filesystem. Each instance requires unique storage.
  - For more information, see the [Soft-Index File Store](https://infinispan.org/blog/2014/10/31/soft-index-file-store).

* **`components.caching-service.storage.infinispan.persistence.indexLocation`**

  The path where the service keeps its index data for the Infinispan Soft-Index Cache Store. 
  The default value is `index`. To run the Caching Service in HA, ensure that you apply the following configuration conditions:

  - The value should be the same for each instance.
  - The location should point to a non-shared filesystem. Each instance requires unique storage.
  - For more information, see the [Soft-Index File Store](https://infinispan.org/blog/2014/10/31/soft-index-file-store).

* **`components.caching-service.storage.infinispan.jgroups.port`**
  
  (Optional) The default value is `7600`. The port number is used by Infinispan to synchronise data among Caching Service instances.

  :::note
  We recommend you define this value to avoid potential problems or errors in future Zowe upgrades, for example
  from version 2.x through v3.1 to v3.2 and newer versions.
  :::

* **`components.caching-service.storage.infinispan.jgroups.host`**

  (Optional) The default value is taken from zowe hostname. The hostname used by Infinispan to synchronise data among Caching Service instances. 


* **`components.caching-service.storage.infinispan.jgroups.keyExchange.port`**

  (Optional) The default value is taken from zowe hostname. The hostname used by Infinispan to synchronise data among Caching Service instances.

* **components.caching-service.storage.infinispan.jgroups.keyExchange.port**

  (Optional) The default value is `7601`. The port number is used by Infinispan to exchange encryption key among Caching Service instances.

  :::note
  We recommend you define this value to avoid potential problems or errors in future Zowe upgrades, for example
  from version 2.x through v3.1 to v3.2 and newer versions.

              jgroups.port: 7600
              initialHosts: lpar2[7600]
              persistence:
                dataLocation: /global/zowe/workspace/caching-service/data
                indexLocation: /global/zowe/workspace/caching-service/index
    lpar2:
