# Implementing profiles in a plug-in
You can use this profile template to create a profile for your product.  

The profile definition is placed in the `imperative.ts` file.

The `type: "someproduct"` property represents the profile name that you might require on various commands to have credentials loaded 
from a secure credential manager and retain the host/port information, so that you can easily swap to different servers from the CLI.

 By default, if your plug-in that is installed into Zoweâ„¢ CLI contains a profile definition that is similar to the following example, a profile template is added automatically to team config JSON when you run the `zowe config init` command. Any properties for which `includeInTemplate` is true are included in the template. Additionally, commands that manage V1 profiles are created automatically under `zowe profiles`. For example, `create`, `validate`, `set-default`, `list`, and so on.


```typescript

    {
      type: "someproduct",
      schema: {
        type: "object",
        title: "Configuration profile for SOME PRODUCT",
        description: "Configuration profile for SOME PRODUCT ",
        properties: {

            }
          },
          port: {
            type: "number",
            optionDefinition: {
