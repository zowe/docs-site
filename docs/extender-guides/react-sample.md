# Add React app to zLUX

:::tip Github Sample Repo:
[basic-react](https://github.com/zowe/webui-scenarios/tree/master/basic-react)
:::

For this section we have provided a react sample (through an Iframe), which connects to the API defined in the API extension sample.

::: tip
Make sure that you first expose an API to connect to before following the steps below. To use the sample provided, first go through the steps listed in [API extension sample](/samples/liberty-api-sample.md).
:::

## To Install

1.  Point your project to the server hosting you API.
    - In the sample this can be defined in the `Constants.js` file.
    - The default is: `localhost:7443`, but otherwise point to your hardware address.
2.  Create a minified version of your project.
    - Generate minified version using `npm run build`
3.  Create folder for project and create new `web` folder inside it.
    - EX: `/Desktop/<Your_Project_Name>` and `Desktop/<Your_Project_Name>/web`
4.  Copy built project into `Desktop/<Your_Project_Name>/web`
    - If using the sample, copy `app.min.js` , `index.html` , `icon.png` and `css` into to `/Desktop/<Your_Project_Name>/web/`
5.  Create a `pluginDefinition.json` [following the guide](../guides/ReactJSUI.html#configuring-your-app-for-zowe) and copy to `Desktop/<Your_Project_Name>/`
    - If using the sample this is included within the project. Copy to `Desktop/<Your_Project_Name>/`
6.  Copy project from `/Desktop` to `<zowe_base>/`
    - Use `scp <userID>@<server> /Users/path/to/files <zowe_base>/`
7.  Create new file within the plugins folder (`<zowe_base>/zlux-example-server-plugins`) called `com.<Your_Project_Name>.json`
    - `touch com.<Your_Project_Name>.json`
8.  Edit this folder (using vi) to read:

```json
{
  "identifier": "com.<Your_Project_Name>",
  "pluginLocation": "../../<Your_Project_Name>"
}
```

9.  Run `./deploy.sh` found in `<zowe_base>/zlux-build`
10. Run `./zowe-stop.sh` found in `<zowe_base>/scripts`
11. Run `./zowe-start.sh` found in `<zowe_base>/scripts`

## Verify Install

Upon restarting the server, navigate to the zlux server.

- This can be found at: `https://<base>:<port>/ZLUX/plugins/com.rs.mvd/web/`

Check to make sure that your new plugin has been added and that it is able to interact with the server.

If it is not able to interact with the server and you are getting CORS errors, you may need to update the server to accept all connections.

::: warning
Note: This is for development purposes only.
:::

To update the server:

- Navigate to `<zowe-base>/explorer-server/wlp/usr/servers/Atlas/server.xml`
- Open to the file with vi and paste the following code in.

```javascript
<!-- FOR TESTING ONLY -->
    <cors allowCredentials="true" allowedMethods="GET, DELETE, POST, PUT, OPTIONS" allowedOrigins="*" allowedHeaders="*" domain="/"/>
<!-- /FOR TESTING ONLY -->
```
