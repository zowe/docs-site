# Troubleshooting Zowe through Zowe Open Community

To help Zowe&trade; Open Community effectively troubleshoot Zowe, we introduce a shell script that captures diagnostics data that is required for successful troubleshooting. By running the shell script on your z/OS environment, you receive a set of output files, which contain all relevant diagnostics data necessary to start a troubleshooting process. You can find the `zowe-support.sh` script in the `ZOWEDIR/scripts` folder with the rest of Zowe scripts. The script captures the following data:

 - Started task output
    - Zowe server started task
    - Zowe Cross Memory started task (STC)
        - Zowe CLI or REXX (TSO output command, STATUS, capture all)
- Zowe Install log
- Scripts that are called from `run-zowe.sh`
 - Versions:
    - manifest.json
    - z/OS version
    - Java version
    - Node version
 - Additional logs
    - Zowe app server 
    - zLUX app server
 - Process list with CPU info with the following data points: 
   - Running command and all arguments of the command
   - Real time that has elapsed since the process started
   - Job name
   - Process ID as a decimal number
   - Parent process ID as a decimal number
   - Processor time that the process used
   - Process user ID (in a form of user name if possible, or as a decimal user ID if not possible)
