# Troubleshooting Zowe Launcher

The following topics contain information that can help you troubleshoot problems when you encounter unexpected behavior using Zowe&trade; Launcher.

Issues and development of the Zowe Launcher is managed in GitHub. When you troubleshoot a problem, you can check whether a GitHub issue (open or closed) that covers the problem already exists. For a list of issues, see the [launcher repo](https://github.com/zowe/launcher).

## Enabling Zowe Launcher Debug Mode

:::warning[Important] 
You should enable debug mode **only** when you want to troubleshoot issues.
Disable debug mode when you are not troubleshooting. Running Zowe Launcher in debug mode can adversely affect its performance and consume a large amount of spool space.
:::

Use debug mode to display additional debug messages for Zowe Launcher.

1. Open the PROCLIB member `ZWESLSTC`.

2. Find `STDENV DD` in-stream data.

3. Add a new line `ZLDEBUG=ON`.
  
  ```jcl
  //STDENV   DD  *
  _CEE_ENVFILE_CONTINUATION=\
  _CEE_RUNOPTS=HEAPPOOLS(OFF),HEAPPOOLS64(OFF)
  _EDC_UMASK_DFLT=0002
  CONFIG=/path/to/zowe.yaml
  ZLDEBUG=ON
  /*
  ```
  By default, debug mode is disabled, in which `ZLDEBUG` is set to `OFF`. To disable debug mode, remove this line or set `ZLDEBUG` to `OFF`.
   
4. Restart `ZWESLSTC` Started Task.

:::tip
    
[`_CEE_ENVFILE_COMMENT`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.5.0?topic=library-cee-envfile-comment) sets the comment character. See the following example, in which the last two lines of in-stream data are commented (not in effect):

```jcl
//STDENV   DD  *
_CEE_ENVFILE_COMMENT=*
_CEE_ENVFILE_CONTINUATION=\
_CEE_RUNOPTS=HEAPPOOLS(OFF),HEAPPOOLS64(OFF)
_EDC_UMASK_DFLT=0002
CONFIG=/path/to/zowe.yaml
* CONFIG=/path/to/zowe-test.yaml
* ZLDEBUG=ON
/*
```

## Troubleshooting port validation

On start up, Zowe uses the `netstat` command to check whether the ports required by its enabled components are available.

Under configuration of dual stack networking, this can fail, with messages similar to the following:

```
Netstat test fail with exit code 16 (EZZ2376I Could not determine TCPIPjobname, using default of 'INET'
...
EZZ2377I Could not establish affinity with INET (1011/11B3005A) - can not provide the requested option information)
```

### Resolving port validation failures

Update the Zowe configuration property `zowe.network.server.validatePortFree` to value `false`:

```yaml
zowe: 
  network:
    server:
      validatePortFree: false
```
