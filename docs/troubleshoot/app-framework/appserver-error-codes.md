# App-server Error Message Codes

The following error message codes may appear on the app-server log. Use the following message code references and the corresponding reasons and actions to help troubleshoot issues.

## App-server informational messages

### ZWED0020I

  Registering at _discoveryUrl_

  **Reason:**

  The app-server is registering its existence to the API ML discovery server, because `components.app-server.node.mediationLayer.enabled=true` is set in the zowe configuration.

  **Action:**

  No action required.



### ZWED0021I

  Eureka Client Registered from _ipAddress_. Available at _discoveryUrl_.

  **Reason:**

  The registration attempt from ZWED0020I has succeeded. The server is known to the API ML discovery server from the address _ipAddress_.

  **Action:**

  No action required.



### ZWED0022I

  Fork worker _workerId_

  **Reason:**

  A new app-server worker process is starting. Workers are redundant execution contexts of the server and increase throughput and latency of requests when the server has a lot of concurrent client requests. Workers are started and stopped according to current server load and the minimum and maximum worker limits defined in environment variables ZLUX_MIN_WORKERS and ZLUX_MAX_WORKERS.

  **Action:**

  No action required.



### ZWED0023I

  Restart worker _workerId_

  **Reason:**

  An existing app-server worker process has exited with a status code that indicates it should be restarted rather than permenantly stopped.

  **Action:**

  Review the preceeding log messages as worker restart may be due to a caught error.



### ZWED0024I

  Keys=_workerIds_

  **Reason:**

  The server lists the worker IDs right before all workers are about to be reloaded.

  **Action:**

  No action required.



### ZWED0025I

  Killing worker pid=_processId_

  **Reason:**

  The server just issued the SIGTERM unix signal to the worker with the process ID listed. This is an expected action when reloading all workers of the server.

  **Action:**

  No action required.



### ZWED0026I

  Fork _quantity_ workers.

  **Reason:**

  The server is starting up _quantity_ new workers. Workers are redundant execution contexts of the server and increase throughput and latency of requests when the server has a lot of concurrent client requests. This message appears at startup and the _quantity_ is determined by the environment variables ZLUX_MIN_WORKERS and ZLUX_MAX_WORKERS.

  **Action:**

  No action required.



### ZWED0027I

  Close worker _workerId_

  **Reason:**

  The server is removing an existing worker due to lack of recent client activity. Workers are added and removed according to average load of the server. Workers are redundant execution contexts of the server and increase throughput and latency of requests when the server has a lot of concurrent client requests. Workers may be removed down to the minimum count as defined by the environment variable ZLUX_MIN_WORKERS.

  **Action:**

  No action required.



### ZWED0028I

  Master _processId_ is running.

  **Reason:**

  The server has started up and is printing its unix process ID in case the user needs to know for analysis or troubleshooting.

  Worker _workerId_ pid _processId_

  **Reason:**

  A worker has started and is listing its ID and unix process ID in case the user needs to know for analysis or troubleshooting. 

  **Action:**

  No action required.



### ZWED0031I

  Server is ready at _ipAddress_, Plugins successfully loaded: _percentage_% (_successful_/_total_)

  **Reason:**

  The server is ready to accept client requests. It can be found at the _ipAddress_ listed, and you can tell if it has loaded all plugins successfully by the _percentage_ listed.

  **Action:**

  If the percentage is less than expected, review the log for messages with IDs ZWED0159W or ZWED0027W. Those messages will tell you which plugins failed, and you can search for their plugin ID within the log to find out the reason they failed to load.



### ZWED0033I

  The http port given to the APIML is: _tcpPort_
  The https port given to the APIML is: _tcpPort_
  The zlux-apiml config are: _jsonConfig_

  **Reason:**

  because it was listed as being a process that should only be started once. 
  Some child processes should be started per-worker for redundancy, 
  while others that need exclusive access to a resource such as
  a network port are specified with the property *childProcess.once*,
  and are skipped on all but one worker. The other workers print 
  this message to indicate this behavior.

  **Action:**

  No action required.



### ZWED0116I

### ZWED0212I

  Environmental variable ZLUX_MIN_WORKERS was not a valid number therefore _count_ will be used as the minimum workers

  **Reason:**

  ZLUX_MIN_WORKERS environment variable is not valid, so the minimum number of workers as part of the cluster will be _count_

  **Action:**

  By default, the App server runs in a cluster. You can specify minimum number of cluster workers. 



### ZWED0213I

  Environmental variable ZLUX_MAX_WORKERS was not a valid number therefore _count_ will be used as the maximum workers.

  **Reason:**

### ZWED0004W

  Tomcat for ID=_id_ not starting, no services succeeded loading

  **Reason:**

  A tomcat instance required for loading a set of java dataservices could not start, so none of the associated dataservices will be available either.

  **Action:**

  Review prior logs to determine the reason the tomcat server is not starting, and address the problem before restarting Zowe in order to access the missing dataservices.



### ZWED0006W

  RBAC is disabled in the configuration. All authenticated users will have access to all services. Enable RBAC in the configuration to control users' access to individual services.

  **Reason:**

  RBAC can be used to permit and reject access to each URL of the app-server individually according to security rules such as those from SAF resources. Enabling RBAC is beneficial but requires configuration first so this message is often seen.

  **Action:**

  If you wish to learn more about RBAC and enable it, read [Application Framework Advanced Configuration](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/mvd-configuration#controlling-access-to-apps)



### ZWED0007W

  Dataservice authentication definition is not present in server configuration file, or malformed.
  Correct the configuration file before restarting the server.

  **Reason:**

  The `components.app-server.dataserviceAuthentication` configuration section is missing or invalid, so the server cannot continue until it is fixed. [Authentication plugins for dataservices are described here](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/extend/extend-desktop/mvd-auth-plugins/)

  **Action:**

  Correct your zowe configuration for this section according to the [app-server schema](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/blob/v2.x/master/schemas/app-server-config.json)



### ZWED0008W

  Error loading auth plugin _pluginIdentifier_: _error_

  **Reason:**

  The plugin could not be loaded due to an error. This plugin may be required for the server to continue, but if it is non-essential then the server will continue to run without the ability to perform authentication against that particular plugin.

  **Action:**

  Review the error to determine the way to fix the plugin before restarting Zowe.



### ZWED0013W
  
  Initializing was not complete for worker _workerId_

  **Reason:**

  A cluster mode worker exited before it fully initialized. Another worker will be started soon to attempt again.

  **Action:**

  If this continues to happen, you should contact support.



### ZWED0014W

  Error adding plugin: _error_

  **Reason:**

  A dynamic plugin, or a plugin added post-startup was unable to be added to the server. The server continues to run, but this plugin was not added.

  **Action:**

  Check the _error_ and lines above in the log to determine the reason for the failure.



### ZWED0015W

  Error reloading workers: _error_

  **Reason:**

  The server was attempting to reload all workers, probably to complete a configuration change. An error occurred instead so some of the workers may not have been reloaded and could contain the old configuration.

  **Action:**

  If you were doing a configuration change, you should try again or restart the server if the error persists. You can check the _error_ to see the reason for the issue.



### ZWED0016W

  Error setting override: _error_

  **Reason:**

  The server attempted to load a new configuration, but failed when writing the configuration update to a file.

  **Action:**

  Check the _error_ to see the possible cause for the failure. Retry this operation but if the issue persists you should restart the server.



### ZWED0017W

  Duplicate plugin identifier _pluginId_ found.

  **Reason:**

  A plugin was trying to be added to the server but it wasn't possible because another plugin with the same ID was already running within the server.

  **Action:**

  Plugin upgrades cannot be done through the add plugin operation. Instead, the server should be stopped to perform this upgrade.



### ZWED0018W

  Could not initialize Java manager. Java services from Apps will not be able to load _stackTrace_

  **Reason:**

  The Java manager is used to run Java services bundled into plugins. It could not start, so the server cannot load any Java services. Plugins that have Java services may fail to load, but the server will still run with the remaining plugins.

  **Action:**

  Check the _stackTrace_ output to determine the reason the Java manager could not run.



### ZWED0019W

  Exception when setting log level for ID=_logId_. E: _stackTrace_

  **Reason:**

  Log levels listed in the configuration file are set during startup. For some reason, the level for _logId_ could not be set, but the server will continue to run with that logger set to default verbosity.

  **Action:**

  Check the _stackTrace_ to determine the reason why _logId_ could not be set. Potentially the log id was an invalid name, or the log level was an invalid number.



### ZWED0020W

  Could not spawn _childProcess_: _errorMessage_

  **Reason:**

  The child process that was requested to run when the server started up could not run for some reason. _childProcess_ lists the parameters requested to start the process.

  **Action:**

  Check the _errorMessage_ to determine the reason of failure, and also verify that the information in _childProcess_ is valid.



### ZWED0021W

  Missing one or more parameters required to run.
  The server requires either HTTP or HTTPS. HTTP Port given: _httpPort_. HTTPS Port given: _httpsPort_
  HTTPS requires either a PFX file or Key & Certificate files.
  Given PFX: _pfx_
  Given Key: _key_
  Given Certificate: _certificate_
  config was: _configuration_
  All but host server and config file parameters should be defined within the config file in JSON format.

  **Reason:**

  The server could not start because the configuration was not valid. When the server's HTTPS section is specified, _httpsPort_ must be a valid TCP port number and you must have a key and certificate. If the HTTPS section is not specified, the HTTP section must be specified and _httpPort_ must be a valid TCP port number.

  **Action:**

  Review the _configuration_ to see if there are corrections to be made before restarting the server.



### ZWED0027W

  Plugin (_pluginId_) loading failed. Version: _versionNumber_. Message: "_errorMessage_" Successful: _percentSuccess_% (_pluginsLoaded_/_pluginsTotal_) Attempted: _percentAttempted_% (_pluginsAttempted_/_pluginsTotal_)

  **Reason:**

  An error prevented the plugin _pluginId_ from loading. Other plugins will still be attempted to be loaded, until _percentAttempted_ reaches 100%. The server will run if all auth plugins needed have successfully loaded.

  **Action:**

  Review _errorMessage_ to see if there is something you can do to fix the error. You may need to contact the plugin developer to find a solution. If you do not need this plugin, it is OK to continue.



### ZWED0028W

  Encountered parse exception while reading _filename_

  **Reason:**

  The server cannot read the JSON file _filename_. This might be a configuration file or a plugin file. In either case, the server may not be able to run or may run with less plugins than desired.

  **Action:**

  Review the file listed in _filename_. Check if it is in the right encoding for your platform. Tagging the file according to its encoding is recommended for z/OS. Also check if the file is valid JSON. The file may have a missing or extra comma, or missing quotes or brackets.



### ZWED0029W

  Authentication plugin was found which was not requested in the server configuration file's dataserviceAuthentication object. Skipping load of this plugin

  **Reason:**

  The server will attempt to load every plugin given to it in the plugins directory. Authentication plugins are only needed if a plugin requests them or it implements the default authentication category. Because the server did not find a user of this plugin, it was not loaded.

  **Action:**

  No action is needed unless you believe that this plugin needed to be loaded. If so, check for plugins that require it to determine if there is missing or incorrect auth configuration.



### ZWED0030W

  _location_ points to an invalid plugin definition, skipping

  **Reason:**

  The file specified at _location_ is not valid according to the [pluginDefinition schema](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/blob/v2.x/staging/schemas/plugindefinition-schema.json), so it cannot be loaded. The server will still start without the plugin if possible.

  **Action:**

  Correct the pluginDefinition.json file of the plugin to load the plugin on next server restart, or remove the plugin if not needed.



### ZWED0032W

  Failed to load _filename_

  **Reason:**

  The plugin definition located at _filename_ could not be read, so the plugin that referred to this cannot be loaded. The server may still run without the plugin if possible.

  **Action:**

  Check if the file exists and is readable to the user that is running the server. Also check that the file is in the right encoding for the OS the app-server is running on. On z/OS, it is recommended to have the file encoding tagged.



### ZWED0033W

  Could not initialize plugin _pluginId_: _error_

  **Reason:**

  The plugin _pluginId_ could not be loaded. This may be due to unsatisfied imports, where an import requested a version of something that was not available, or an entire plugin was not available.  The server will still attempt to load if this plugin was not needed.

  **Action:**

  Check the _error_ message to determine the cause of error for correction.



### ZWED0034W

  Skipping install of plugin due to existing plugin with same id=_identifier_

  **Reason:**

  The plugin could not be loaded due to a plugin that is already loaded containing the same _identifier_ ID. Plugin IDs are unique, so the first plugin with that ID that is seen is the one that is loaded.

  **Action:**

  Check to see if you have 2 extensions that contain plugins with the same ID. Alternatively, an extension may have updated to have its name change without its ID changing, causing a duplicate to appear. You may need to clean up your extensions or the contents of the pluginsDir directory.



### ZWED0035W

  Error thrown when installing plugin=_identifier_: _error_ 

  **Reason:**

  The plugin with id _identifier_ could not be added to the server because of an error that occurred. The server will still attempt to run without the plugin if possible.

  **Action:**

  Check the _error_ message to see the reason for the error, and correct it before restarting the server in order to try loading the plugin again.



### ZWED0036W

  Uncaught exception found. Error: _stackTrace_

  **Reason:**

  The server encountered an unexpected error. If cluster mode is running, this will result in the worker crashing but the cluster starting a new worker to replace it. The client that initiated the request will need to retry the operation though other clients should not experience disruption.
  
  If cluster mode is not running, the process will end but the launcher will restart it. In this case, state may be lost unless the caching service was also being used.

  **Action:**

  The _stackTrace_ should be sent to developers so that the issue can be fixed.



### ZWED0037W

  Ending server process due to uncaught exception.

  **Reason:**

  The server is stopping after encountering ZWED00036W.

  **Action:**

  Rejected undefined referrer for url=_originalUrl_, ip=_ip_

  **Reason:**

  Throws 403 Forbidden when App server fails to honor a network request due to failed referrer check. 

  **Action:**

  Double check the address. A possible reason for a 403 error is a misstyped _originalUrl_ or _ip_ or because loopback routing is not configured in the App server.



### ZWED0172W

  Rejected bad referrer=_referrerHeaderValue_ for url=_accessedUrl_, ip=_clientIp_

  **Reason:**

  The client from _clientIp_ tried to access _accessedUrl_ but due to having a referrer header value that didn't seem to originate from this server, a security violation was caused and the attempt to access the URL was rejected.

  **Action:**

  Review the values to determine if this was a valid attempt to access the server or not. If this access seems suspicious, then the server was correct in rejecting the access. However, if the access attempt seemed legitimate, then this points to the referrer configuration needing revision. You can customize which referrer header values are permitted using the environment variable ZWE_REFERRER_HOSTS and it should be set to match the external hostnames of the system the app-server is running on.



### ZWED0173W

  Unable to decode P12 certificate (different password than keystore?). Attempting to use empty string as password. Decode error: _error_.

  **Reason:**

  The server tried to load the p12 file provided for the server certificate or certificate authorities, but encountered _error_. The server may not be accessible as a result of invalid TLS configuration.

  **Action:**

  Check the value of zowe.certificate.keystore.password and zowe.certificate.truststore.password, or the environment variable KEYSTORE_PASSWORD to see if they are valid for the p12 file provided, and adjust the configuration if needed. 



### ZWED0174W

  _componentName_ could not verify (_operatingSystem_) as a supported platform to install (_pluginId_). Proceeding anyway...

  **Reason:**

  The plugin _pluginId_ has a dependency which can only run on certain operating systems, and _operatingSystem_ is not on the list, but because the operating system is not explicitly forbidden, the server will attempt to load the plugin anyway. This may fail, but the server may continue to run without the plugin if possible.

  **Action:**

  Review the plugin dependencies as seen in the plugin's pluginDefinition.json file to see if your Zowe configuration or the plugin can be changed in order to match the requirements. Consult the plugin developer if you believe the plugin was able to run fine on the operating system, so they can explicitly add support in the future.



### ZWED0175W

  _componentName_ could not verify (_systemArchitecture_) as a supported architecture to install (_pluginId_). Proceeding anyway...

  **Reason:**

  The plugin _pluginId_ has a dependency which can only run on certain system architectures, and _systemArchitecture_ is not on the list, but because the system architecture is not explicitly forbidden, the server will attempt to load the plugin anyway. This may fail, but the server may continue to run without the plugin if possible.

  **Action:**

  Review the plugin dependencies as seen in the plugin's pluginDefinition.json file to see if your Zowe configuration or the plugin can be changed in order to match the requirements. Consult the plugin developer if you believe the plugin was able to run fine on the system architecture, so they can explicitly add support in the future.



### ZWED0177W

  Unable to load _actionOrRecognizer_ for '_pluginId_' into config

  **Reason:**

  The plugin _pluginId_ has an action or recognizer within its package and the plugin install process was trying to copy that into the workspace so it can be used, but encountered an error that prevented this.

  **Action:**

  Contact support if the reason cannot be determined.



### ZWED0178W

  Skipping authentication plugin _pluginId_ because it's not HA compatible

  **Reason:**

  The server is setup for running in high availability (HA) mode which requires that plugins that have state, in particular authentication plugins, must be HA-compatible or else errors will occur. Therefore, the server skips over loading of this plugin nbecause its pluginDefinition.json did not state it was HA compatible.

  **Action:**

  Either the plugin must be updated to support and state its support for HA, or it must be removed, or HA mode disabled. To make a plugin support HA, the conformance program should be reviewed. When HA mode is supported, the plugin can be marked as compatible by setting capabilities.haCompatible=true within its initialization.



### ZWED0179W

  Unable to retrieve the list of certificate authorities from the keyring=_keyringName_ owner=_username_ Error: _error_

  **Reason:**

  The server could not automatically determine the certificate authorities (CA) from the z/OS keyring listed. This may cause the server to be unable to verify certificate chains from other servers or clients causing other errors later.

  **Action:**

  Review the error to resolve it and contact support if needed. It's also possible as a workaround to explicitly state the CAs within the keyring that you would like to load, rather than relying upon the server's attempt to automatically find all CAs within the keyring.



### ZWED0001E

  Error: _error_

  **Reason:**

  The server is running in cluster mode and the cluster manager has encountered an unexpected error.

  **Action:**

  Review the error to resolve it, and contact support if needed.



### ZWED0002E

  Could not stop language manager for types=_languageNames_

  **Reason:**

  A plugin had a service that needed a language manager to run. During shutdown, the language manager could not be stopped.

  **Action:**

  The language manager may continue to run after the app-server shuts down. Review the logs to determine the location of the language manager and try to stop the manager manually.



### ZWED0003E

  Loopback configuration not valid, _loobackConfiguration_
  Loopback calls will fail!

  **Reason:**

  The loopback configuration that the server uses to contact itself over an internal network was missing a value for the network port, therefore no requests over the loopback address will be possible.

  **Action:**

  Review the configuration of `components.app-server.node.port` to see if it has a value and set one to fix the issue.



### ZWED0004E

  Could not listen on address _ip_:_port_. It is already in use by another process.

  **Reason:**

  The server tried to start using the ip and port values shown which were from the zowe configuration. When trying to connect to this address, the server recieved an error telling it that the address was already in use.

  **Action:**

  Check the system's network port status to see what program could be using this address, and either stop that program or change the zowe configuration to use a different address before restarting zowe.



### ZWED0005E

  Could not listen on address _ip_:_port_. Invalid IP for this system.

  **Reason:**

  When the app-server was binding to the address shown, it recieved the error EADDRNOTAVAIL or ENOTFOUND. In either case, the app-server was not able to bind to the address and so it will not run until the problem is solved.

  **Action:**

  Review the address and check if it is valid or if there is some lack of permissions that might explain why these errors were received by the server.



### ZWED0006E

  Usage: --inputApp | -i INPUTAPP --pluginsDir | -p PLUGINSDIR --zluxConfig | -c ZLUXCONFIGPATH [--verbose | -v]

  **Reason:**

  This message appearas when you attempt app installation but have not provided enough of the mandatory arguments for the program to run. It is printing out what options are valid so that you can retry with different options.

  **Action:**

  Retry the operation after modifying the input arguments to be valid against the list shown. Or, if you are trying to do app installation, you should use `zwe components install` instead whenever possible.



### ZWED0007E

  _serviceName_ invalid version _version_

  **Reason:**

  The service mentioned was trying to be loaded by the server but failed validation due to the version number not being a a valid semver string. This service and therefore plugin will be skipped during loading.

  **Action:**

  Contact the developers so that they can revise the pluginDefinition.json of the plugin where the service is located to be semver-compatible. Details on semver version can be found at semver.org



### ZWED0008E

  _localServiceName_: invalid version range _serviceName_: _versionRange_

  **Reason:**

  When the _serviceName_ was trying to be imported into a plugin as _localServiceName_, the version range of acceptable versions for the service to be imported was not valid. Due to this, the import cannot be resolved and the plugin will be skipped in loading.

  **Action:**

  Contact the developers of the plugin this error occurred in as the pluginDefinition.json needs to be revised to have the version range given for this import service be a valid semver range string.



### ZWED0009E

  _localServiceName_: invalid version range _versionRange_

  **Reason:**

  When the a service was trying to be imported into a plugin as _localServiceName_, the version range of acceptable versions for the service to be imported was not valid. Due to this, the import cannot be resolved and the plugin will be skipped in loading.

  **Action:**

  Contact the developers of the plugin this error occurred in as the pluginDefinition.json needs to be revised to have the version range given for this import service be a valid semver range string.



### ZWED0010E

  No file name for data service

  **Reason:**

  When the server was trying to load a service for a plugn, it couldn't identify the filename where the service is located within the plugin, so the service and therefore plugin have been skipped during loading.

  **Action:**

  Contact the plugin developer to fix that the service within the pluginDefinition.json is missing the "fileName" or "filename" property which must describe the path to the dataservice entry file, relative to the plugin's lib directory.



### ZWED0011E

  Plugin _pluginId_ has web content but no web directory under _location_

  **Reason:**

  The plugin definition of _pluginId_ stated that the plugin has web content to serve such as HTML files, but the required 'web' folder was missing, so the plugin cannot be loaded.

  **Action:**

  Check that the web folder within this plugin exists or not. If it does exist, then the server may not have had permission to read it. Otherwise, if it doesn't exist, try to reinstall the plugin in case it is corrupt. Or, contact the developers to fix the lack of web directory.



### ZWED0012E

  _pluginId_::_serviceName_ Required local service missing: _localService_

  **Reason:**

  The service _serviceName_ could not be loaded because of an unsatisfied version requirement upon another service. This causes the plugin _pluginId_ to be skipped during loading.

  **Action:**

  Review the plugin's definition to see why the version match could not be made. Either a required plugin is missing, or the pluginDefinition.json will need to be revised by the developer of the plugin to fix the version check failure.



### ZWED0013E

  _pluginId_::_serviceName_ Could not find a version to satisfy local dependency _serviceName_@_requiredVersion_

  **Reason:**

  The service _serviceName_ could not be loaded because of an unsatisfied version requirement upon another service. This causes the plugin _pluginId_ to be skipped during loading.

  **Action:**

  Review the plugin's definition to see why the version match could not be made. Either a required plugin is missing, or the pluginDefinition.json will need to be revised by the developer of the plugin to fix the version check failure.



### ZWED0014E

  Plugin _pluginId_ invalid

  **Reason:**

  The plugin could not be loaded because the plugin definition was not valid in some way. There are fields that every plugin must define, such as type. Then, depending on type, there are more fields a plugin can and cannot have. When the server went to load the plugin, it found that the definition was not correct versus the requirements, so the loading of this plugin was skipped.

  **Action:**

  Contact the developers of this plugin so that they can fix the plugin to adhere to the [plugin schema](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/blob/v2.x/master/schemas/plugindefinition-schema.json)



### ZWED0015E

  No plugin directory found at _pluginLocation_

  **Reason:**

  The server finds plugins by reading JSON files within the "plugins" folder of its workspace directory. When it checked the JSON of this particular plugin, the JSON stated the plugin could be found at a folder _pluginLocation_ which either does not exist or could not be read by the server.

  **Action:**

  Check that the location shown exists. If it does exist, then there is some permission problem preventing the server from reading it. If it does not exist, determine whether this plugin is desired but has the wrong location, or if this plugin is not desired and should be removed. Contact support so they can assist in fixing the plugin location problem.



### ZWED0016E

  No pluginDefinition.json found at _pluginLocation_

  **Reason:**

  The server finds plugins by reading JSON files within the "plugins" folder of its workspace directory. When it checked the JSON of this particular plugin, it stated the plugin was located in a folder which the server determined did not contain the pluginDefinition.json file that every plugin requires. Due to this missing file, the loading of this plugin was skipped.

  **Action:**

  Check that a pluginDefinition.json exists at the location specified. If it does, then the server is missing permissions necessary to read the file. If the file does not exist, review if there is a problem with the plugin itself that should be resolved by contacting the plugin developers. If the plugin exists with a pluginDefinition.json file at a different location than the error suggests, contact Zowe support to resolve the location problem.



### ZWED0017E 

  Identifier doesn't match one found in pluginDefinition: _pluginIdentifier_

  **Reason:**

  The identifier found in the plugin reference doesn't match the one specified in the pluginDefinition.json

  **Action:**

  Check if identifier found is the same one as intended (typo perhaps?). If not, delete the plugin identifier JSON (found in instance/workspace/app-server/plugins) and restart Zowe. If issue isn't resolved, increase app server debugging and send logs to the app developer



### ZWED0018E 

  No plugin type found, skipping

  **Reason:**

  The plugin definition for the plugin has no 'pluginType' property set

  **Action:**

  Contact app developers if you need plugin to be loaded and working



### ZWED0019E 

  Plugin already registered

  **Reason:**

  A plugin with this identifier has already been registered to the map of plugins

  **Action:**

  Check if you have multiple components sharing the same, or different versions, of the same plugin. This is not allowed



### ZWED0020E 

  "_pluginIdentifier_: pluginType _type_ is unknown

  **Reason:**

  The plugin _pluginIdentifier_ has in its plugin definition an invalid plugin _type_

  **Action:**

  Accepted plugin types found in the schema (https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/blob/v2.x/staging/schemas/plugindefinition-schema.json#L47)



### ZWED0021E

  _pluginPath_ is missing

  **Reason:**

  App server tried to process the plugin reference from path _pluginPath_

  **Action:**

  Check if _pluginPath_ is a real path or the App server (started task user of Zowe) has the permission to read it



### ZWED0022E
  
  Module not found _moduleName_

  **Reason:**

  App server, during a cluster/worker method call, tried to require a module _moduleName_ it couldn't find

  **Action:**

  Contact the plugin developer if plugin returns this error.



### ZWED0023E

  Method not implemented _methodName_

  **Reason:**

  App server, during a cluster/worker method call, tried to act on a method that isn't valid.

  **Action:**

  Contact the plugin developer if plugin returns this error.



### ZWED0024E

  Object not exported _exportName_

  **Reason:**

  App server, during a cluster/worker method call, tried and failed to export a module object.

  **Action:**

  Contact the plugin developer if plugin returns this error.



### ZWED0025E

  .authenticate() missing

  **Reason:**

  Authentication plugin (which plugin includes looking at nearby log messages) is missing the .authenticate() method.

  **Action:**

  Contact the plugin developer if plugin is essential for authenticaiton.



### ZWED0026E

  Circular dependency: _pluginIdentifier_

  **Reason:**

  The App server encountered a circular dependency for plugin _pluginIdentifier_ (meaning it contains a dependency that imports itself).

  **Action:**

  Contact the plugin developer for troubleshooting help. This is a packaging issue.



### ZWED0027E

  Circular dependency: _pluginIdentifier_

  **Reason:**

   The App server encountered a circular dependency for plugin _pluginIdentifier_ (meaning it contains a dependency that imports itself).

  **Action:**

  Contact the plugin developer for troubleshooting help. This is a packaging issue.



### ZWED0028E

  Config invalid

  **Reason:**

  The App server attempted to validate and process the server configuration and there was an issue.

  **Action:**

  Please consult the App server schema components.app-server.node section (https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/blob/v2.x/staging/schemas/app-server-config.json#L9). You may also instead have a syntax issue. For a free, offline YAML validator, check out RedHat's VSCode YAML Extension



### ZWED0038E
  
  JavaManager given port range beyond limits

  **Reason:**

  The Java manager was given a port outside the valid port range (0 < 65535).

  **Action:**

  Please check your configuration to see if any ports are out of bounds.



### ZWED0039E

  JavaManager not given any ports with which to run servers.

  **Reason:**

  Configuration does not contain ports for Java manager to try to run the servers.

  **Action:**

  Please check your configuration to see if any ports are missing.



### ZWED0040E 

  Unknown java war grouping default=_grouping_

  **Reason:**

  For this war, an unknown grouping default _grouping_ was encountered (types: 'microservice' or 'appserver' allowed).

  **Action:**

  Contact the plugin developer for troubleshooting.



### ZWED0041E

  Could not find port to use for configuration, at config position=_portIndex_.

  **Reason:**

  The server was trying to determine a network port to use for a Java dataservice, but no available ports could be found, so the server cannot load that service.

  **Action:**

  Check your Zowe configuration to see if you have enough or any ports specified for the app-server to use when assigning ports to Java dataservices.



### ZWED0042E

 Could not find runtime to satisfy group: _javaRuntime_

  **Reason:**

  When trying to run a group of Java dataservices under a common java runtime, the _javaRuntime_ couldn't be found, so the dataservices cannot be run.

  **Action:**

  Check the configuration for this group of Java services to see if _javaRuntime_ is a good value, and resolve the Java issue before restarting the server.



### ZWED0043E

 Unknown java app server type=_javaRuntimeTime_ specified in config. Cannot continue with java loading.

  **Reason:**

  The app-server can only handle Java dataservices if they run under certain types of Java server runtimes. The type chosen was not one of the types supported, so the server cannot continue with the loading.

  **Action:**

  Check if the version of the plugin you are using is compatible with the version of Zowe you are using. Check if you can change the "type" of java server to one that the app-server does work with, such as "tomcat".



### ZWED0044E

 Java runtimes not specified, and no JAVA_HOME set

  **Reason:**

  The app-server cannot run the java dataservices because it doesn't know how to start any Java with the configuration specified.

  **Action:**

  Either define the environment variable JAVA_HOME to point to a valid Java runtime home, or specify a Java runtime within the app-server configuration as `components.app-server.languages.java.runtimes`. For more information, see the server schema https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/blob/v2.x/master/schemas/app-server-config.json



### ZWED0045E

 Java app server not defined in config

  **Reason:**

  A dataservice was configured to run from a WAR file but the configuration section `components.app-server.languages.java.war.javaAppServer` was missing, so the app-server could not run the dataservice.

  **Action:**

  Define the missing configuration section according to the app-server schema https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/blob/v2.x/master/schemas/app-server-config.json or remove it and the plugin that required it.



### ZWED0046E

 JavaManager not given either war or jar configuration options, nothing to do

  **Reason:**

  A java dataservice was requested but the `components.app-server.languages.java` configuration section of Zowe was missing either a `war` or `jar` subsection. Since one of the two is needed, the server could not continue with loading the java dataservices.

  **Action:**

  Review the app-server schema https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/blob/v2.x/master/schemas/app-server-config.json and your Zowe configuration file to identify and correct the missing properties within `components.app-server`.



### ZWED0047E

 Proxy (_pluginid_:_servicename_) setup failed.
 Host & Port for proxy destination are required but were missing.
 For information on how to configure a proxy service, see the Zowe wiki on dataservices (https://github.com/zowe/zlux/wiki/ZLUX-Dataservices)

  **Reason:**

  A proxy was requested by the service _pluginid_:_servicename_ but the service configuration or pluginDefinition did not specify what the proxy destination was, so the server is skipping the loading of that plugin.

  **Action:**

  Review the plugin's configuration or contact the developer of that plugin to correct the proxy configuration.



### ZWED0049E

 Can't specify error metadata

  **Reason:**

  When a dataservice called the utility function makeErrorObject, it did not supply context of the `_objectType` and `_metaDataVersion`, which are required and caused the function to throw its own error about the lack of information.

  **Action:**

  Contact the developer of the plugin which caused this error.



### ZWED0050E

 Root service _serviceName_ not found

  **Reason:**

  A dataservice tried to call a "root", or non-plugin service of the app-server or app-server's agent, and this root service _serviceName_ was not found on the server, so the request failed.

  **Action:**

  Verify that your version of Zowe works with the plugins that you have installed, and contact the developer of the plugin which tried to call this missing root service.



### ZWED0051E

 Could not resolve service URL. Plugin=_pluginId_, service=_serviceName_

  **Reason:**

  A dataservice _serviceName_ handled by a language manager could not be used because the URL in which to access this dataservice from its language manager could not be determined.

  **Action:**

  Check the logs to see if there was trouble installing the service or plugin, and contact the developers of _pluginId_ for more support.



### ZWED0052E

 Could not load service _pluginId_:_serviceName_ due to unknown type=_serviceType_

  **Reason:**

  The service from the plugin shown could not be loaded because the plugin declared the service to be of some type that the app-server does not handle.

  **Action:**

  Check to see if the version of Zowe you are using works with the version of the plugin you are using. Plugins must have dataservices only of types seen within the pluginDefinition schema https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/blob/v2.x/staging/schemas/plugindefinition-schema.json



### ZWED0053E

 Import _sourcePluginId_:_sourceServiceName_ can't be satisfied

  **Reason:**

  A plugin trying to load a dataservice from _sourcePluginId_:_sourceServiceName_ couldn't load that service, therefore the requesting plugin will fail to load.

  **Action:**

  Confirm that the source plugin and service exist. Check the logs to see if there was something that caused the source service to fail loading. Contact the developers of either source or target plugin for more assistance if the cause is not clear.



### ZWED0111E

  SEVERE: Exception occurred trying to generate object from input: _error_

  **Reason:**

  The server could not parse its input configuration due to the error shown, so the server cannot start.

  **Action:**

  Review the error to determine the cause, or contact support if the cause is unclear.



### ZWED0112E

 The server found no plugin implementing the specified default authentication type of _type_.

  **Reason:**

  The value of `components.app-server.dataserviceAuthentication.defaultAuthentication` within the server configuration specified a type of authentication that some authentication plugin must implement in order for the server to run. Because no plugin that successfully loaded declared that it implemented this type, the server found no implementation and could not continue.

  **Action:**

  Review if any plugin you have implements the given type. If the type is incorrect, revise the configuration to choose a type that does exist in your system. If the type is correct, check if you are missing a required plugin.



### ZWED0113E

 The server found no authentication types. Verify that the server configuration file defines server authentication.

  **Reason:**

  The server was unable to find any authentication plugins where at least one is required to run.

  **Action:**

  Review the list of plugins that are being used and see if any authentication plugins you needed have failed to load, and review their error messages.



### ZWED0114E

 The server found no plugin implementing the specified default authentication type of _type_.

  **Reason:**

  The value of `components.app-server.dataserviceAuthentication.defaultAuthentication` within the server configuration specified a type of authentication that some authentication plugin must implement in order for the server to run. Because no plugin that successfully loaded declared that it implemented this type, the server found no implementation and could not continue.

  **Action:**

  Review if any plugin you have implements the given type. If the type is incorrect, revise the configuration to choose a type that does exist in your system. If the type is correct, check if you are missing a required plugin.



### ZWED0115E

 Unable to retrieve storage object from cluster. This is probably due to a timeout.
 You may change the default of '_storageTimeout_' ms by setting 'node.cluster.storageTimeout' within the config.

  **Reason:**

  The app-server was running in cluster mode and a service attempted to get content from the cluster storage but this failed. Because storage could not be read, its possible the service that requested the storage will have further errors.

  **Action:**

  If there was a network disruption or performance issue, a timeout could have occurred. Review the rest of the logs to see if there are other messages to explain the failure. You can attempt to avoid timeout-related failures by editing the configuration parameter `components.app-server.node.cluster.storageTimeout`.



### ZWED0145E

 Cannot load SAF keyring content outside of z/OS

  **Reason:**

  The Zowe configuration of `zowe.certificate` or `components.app-server.node.https` specifies SAF keyrings as locations to find keystore and truststore data. SAF keyrings only exist on z/OS, and the server detected it was not running on z/OS so it cannot continue.

  **Action:**

  Modify the configuration to use a different keystore type, or migrate the server to z/OS.



### ZWED0146E

 SAF keyring data had no attribute "_attribute_". Attributes=_attributeKeys_

  **Reason:**

  Within the list of _attributeKeys_, _attribute_ could not be found.

  **Action:**

  Check the keystore configuration of the server such as in `zowe.certificate` or `components.app-server.node.https` to see if it is valid for Zowe. The SAF keyring Zowe was configured to use may be missing a key and certificate pair, or certificate authorities keychain. For more suggestions on configuring keyrings for Zowe, review the [install guide](../../user-guide/certificate-configuration-scenarios#scenario-4-use-a-zos-keyring-based-keystore-and-connect-to-an-existing-certificate)



### ZWED0147E

 SAF keyring data was not found for "_keyName_"

  **Reason:**

  The server tried to read the SAF keyring specified within the Zowe configuration, but ran into an error where the server received no data instead.

  **Action:**

  Review the logs to see if a reason for the error is shown. Verify that the Zowe configuration points to a valid keyring that the Zowe server user has permissions to read.



### ZWED0148E

 Exception thrown when reading SAF keyring, e=_error_

  **Reason:**

  The SAF keyring which the app-server was configured to use could not be read due to an error. The server likely will not start or will be unable to do any network activity until this error is resolved.

  **Action:**

  Review the error message to determine the cause. Often, the error messages will originate from a system service where the documentation can be found here https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.5.0?topic=library-return-reason-codes



### ZWED0149E

 SAF keyring reference missing userId "_user_", keyringName "_name_", or label "_label_"

  **Reason:**

  The server configuration specified that the app-server should load keystore and truststore content from a SAF keyring, but the syntax in the configuration was incorrect, because _user_, _name_, or _label_ were not usable by the server.

  **Action:**

  Check the `zowe.certificate` or `components.app-server.node.https` sections of Zowe configuration to see if there are entries that start with `safkeyring://` and verify that they are in the format of `safkeyring://USERNAME:RINGNAME&LABEL`. Older versions of zowe will require that there be 4 slashes, such as `safkeyring:////`. The `&LABEL` suffix is only needed for specifying certificate authorities and should be omitted in other sections, for example it is only needed within `zowe.certificate.pem.certificateAuthorities` or `components.app-server.node.https.certificateAuthorities`. For more suggestions on configuring keyrings for Zowe, review the [install guide](../../user-guide/certificate-configuration-scenarios#scenario-4-use-a-zos-keyring-based-keystore-and-connect-to-an-existing-certificate)



### ZWED0150E

 Cannot load SAF keyring due to missing keyring_js library

  **Reason:**

  The Zowe configuration specified that the app-server should load keystore and truststore information from a SAF keyring, which requires the nodejs library keyring_js. This library is defined within the package.json of zlux-server-framework and ships with Zowe installs, but could not be loaded for some reason and therefore the server could not load keyrings and will either stop or have issues with network communication.

  **Action:**

  Use the command `zwe support` to verify if the Zowe install has all files expected, as this message indicates the keyring_js library is missing and reinstalling Zowe may be required.



### ZWED0151E

 Env var _variableName_ not found

  **Reason:**

  The server was loading plugins. It determines the location of each plugin via a plugin pointer file. The plugin referenced in the logs, it's location is dynamically determined by an environment variable _variableName_. Because the variable did not resolve to a value, the plugin could not be found and could not be loaded.

  **Action:**

  Review the documentation for the plugin that failed to load, check what the value of the variable should be, and contact support for that plugin if needed.



### ZWED0152E

 Unable to locate server config instance location and INSTANCE_DIR environment variable does not exist.

  **Reason:**

  While installing a plugin, the server could not determine the location of the configuration dataservice's "instance" folder. Due to this, the plugin could not be completely installed.

  **Action:**

  Correct the error before reinstalling the plugin. This error could happen due to an incorrect value for `components.app-server.instanceDir` and normally defaults to `{{ zowe.workspaceDirectory }}/app-server`.



### ZWED0153E

 (_operatingSystemName_) is not a supported platform for _componentName_. Skipping (_pluginid_)... Supported: _requiredOperatingSystem_

  **Reason:**

  The Zowe host operating system _operatingSystemName_ is not supported by the component _componentName_. Supported platforms are defined in the component's pluginDefinition.json.

  **Action:**

  Refer to _componentName_ pluginDefinition.json for supported platforms. The installation of Zowe may also be moved to a supported platform. Lastly, contact the author of the component, or a system administrator.



### ZWED0154E

 (_architectureName_) is not a supported architecture for _componentName_. Skipping (_pluginid_)... Supported: _requiredArchitecture_

  **Reason:**

  The Zowe host architecture is not supported by _componentName_. Supported architectures are defined in the component's pluginDefintion.json.

  **Action:**

  Refer to _componentName_ pluginDefinition.json for supported architectures. The installation of Zowe may also be moved to a supported architecture. Lastly, contact the author of the component, or a system administrator.



### ZWED0155E

 (_url_) is not a supported endpoint for _componentName_. Skipping (_pluginid_)... Supported: _urls_

  **Reason:**

  The endpoint _url_ does not match any required endpoints of _componentName_. Supported endpoints may be viewd in the component's pluginDefinition.json.

  **Action:**

 Refer to _componentName_ pluginDefinition.json for supported endpoints. Optionally, remove _url_ from the required endpoints in pluginDefinition.json. Lastly, contact the author of the component, or a system administrator.



### ZWED0156E

 Could not register default plugins into app-server.

  **Reason:**

  org.zowe.zlux.json is missing from app-server plugin directory. This error will cause the process to exit. 

  **Action:**

  Verify integrity of Zowe installation, or contact system administrator. Please refer to https://docs.zowe.org/stable/appendix/zwe_server_command_reference/zwe/support/zwe-support for collecting Zowe runtime information.



### ZWED0157E

 Could not register default plugin _pluginid_ into app-server.

  **Reason:**

  Could not register default plugin _pluginid_ into app-server due to plugin upgrade failure.

  **Action:**

  Verify integrity of plugin files, or contact system administrator. Please refer to https://docs.zowe.org/stable/appendix/zwe_server_command_reference/zwe/support/zwe-support for collecting Zowe runtime information.



### ZWED0158E

 Could not listen on address _ipAddress_:_port_. Insufficient permissions to perform port bind.

  **Reason:**

  Server could not bind to port due to an EACCES error. User lacks privilege to perform port bind. This error will cause the process to exit.

  **Action:**

  Contact system administrator.
