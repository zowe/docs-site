# Gathering information to troubleshoot Zowe Application Framework

If you need to contact a support group for Zowe, they will likely need a variety of information from you to help you. This page details a list of items you should gather to the best of your ability to provide to your support group. You may also find this list useful for independent troubleshooting.

## Basic information

Please review [the list of information needed for general server support](../servers/must-gather.md).

## Javascript console output

When the web UI such as the Zowe Desktop or Apps inside it have an issue, the root problem may originate from either server-side or browser-side behavior.
In addition to the server logs, the browser logs should be gathered. They can be accessed by opening a browser's web developer toolkit. Most browsers allow this via pressing F12.
