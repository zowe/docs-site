## Error Jobs search failing

### Error:

Search for jobs using SDSF failed for prefix {} and owner {}: exc.sdsf_invocation_failed 8 (Issue does not impace ZD&T boxes)

### Solution:

You must be authorized to use SDSF with REXX on your z/OS system. In order to do this, activate the SDSF RACF class and add the following 3 profiles to your system:

- GROUP.ISFSORIG
- GROUP.ISFSPROG.SDSF
- ISF.CONNECT.

Users must belong to a group that has READ access to these profiles.

This is quite a complex area and you should ask your systems programmer for advice. On most systems, the GROUP.\* profiles are not required and it is sufficient to have the following ISF profile defined:

class profile SDSF ISF.CONNECT.\*\* (G)
