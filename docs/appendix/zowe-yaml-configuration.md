# Zowe YAML configuration file reference

Zowe v2 uses a YAML configuration file during installation, configuration, and runtime. This file is usually referred to as the Zowe configuration YAML file or the `zowe.yaml` file. YAML is a human-friendly data serialization language for all programming languages. To learn more about YAML specifications, see [https://yaml.org/](https://yaml.org/). For a free, offline YAML validator to help validate your syntax, download the [Red Hat's VS Code YAML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml).

**Note:** In the following sections, we refer to configuration keys by using the concatenation of key names and dots. For example, if you want to update the configuration key `zowe.certificate.keystore.type` with value `PKCS12`, you should set value for this entry in the `zowe.yaml`:

```yaml
zowe:
  certificate:
    keystore:
      type: PKCS12
```

### High-level overview of YAML configuration file

The YAML configuration file has few high-level sections:

- **`zowe`**  
 Defines global configurations specific to Zowe, including default values.
- **`java`**  
 Defines Java configurations used by Zowe components.
- **`node`**  
 Defines node.js configurations used by Zowe components.
- **`zOSMF`**  
 Tells Zowe your z/OSMF configurations.
- **`components`**  
 Defines detailed configurations for each Zowe component or extension. Each component or extension may have a key entry under this section. For example, `components.gateway` is configuration for the API Mediation Layer Gateway service.
- **`haInstances`**  
 Defines customized configurations for each High Availability (HA) instance. You should predefine all Zowe HA instances you want to start within your Sysplex.

### Extract sharable configuration out of zowe.yaml

The Zowe YAML configuration file supports a special `@include` annotation that can be used in any level of the configuration. This enables you to organize your YAML configuration files and extract sharable configurations to a separate YAML file.

For example, you can define a sharable certificate configuration file `<keystore-dir>/zowe-certificates.yaml` like this:

```yaml
keystore:
  type: PKCS12
  file: /global/zowe/keystore/localhost/localhost.keystore.p12
  password: password
  alias: localhost
truststore:
  type: PKCS12
  file: /global/zowe/keystore/localhost/localhost.truststore.p12
  password: password
pem:
  key: /global/zowe/keystore/localhost/localhost.key
  certificate: /global/zowe/keystore/localhost/localhost.cer
  certificateAuthorities: /global/zowe/keystore/local_ca/local_ca.cer
```

Then in your `zowe.yaml`, you can import this certification file like this:

```yaml
zowe:
  certificate:
    @include: "<keystore-dir>/zowe-certificates.yaml"
```

### Configuration override

Inside `zowe.yaml`, you can define default values and they may be overridden in more granular level configurations. This can happen in several ways:

- The component can override the default certificate configuration. For the specific entry of certification configuration, if it's not overridden, it falls back to default configurations.  

**Example:**

  ```yaml
  zowe:
    certificate:
      keystore:
        type: PKCS12
        file: /global/zowe/keystore/localhost/localhost.keystore.p12
        password: password
        alias: localhost
      truststore:
        type: PKCS12
        file: /global/zowe/keystore/localhost/localhost.truststore.p12
        password: password
      pem:
        key: /global/zowe/keystore/localhost/localhost.key
        certificate: /global/zowe/keystore/localhost/localhost.cer
        certificateAuthorities: /global/zowe/keystore/local_ca/local_ca.cer
  components:
    app-server:
      certificate:
        keystore:
          alias: app-server
        pem:
          key: /global/zowe/keystore/localhost/app-server.key
          certificate: /global/zowe/keystore/localhost/app-server.cer
  ```
  
  App Server will use the certificate alias `app-server` instead of `localhost` from the same keystore defined in `zowe.certificate.keystore.file`. And it will use the exact same truststore defined in `zowe.certificate.truststore.file`.

- Zowe high availability (HA) instance component configuration `haInstances.<ha-instance>.components.<component>` can override global level component configurations `components.<component>`. Any configuration you can find in `components.<component>` level can be overridden in `haInstances.<ha-instance>.components.<component>` level. For example, in this configuration:

  ```yaml
  components:
    app-server:
      enabled: true
      port: 8544
  haInstances:
    lpar2a:
      components:
        app-server:
          enabled: false
    lpar2b:
      components:
        app-server:
          port: 28544
  ```
  
  App Server on `lpar2a` HA instance will not be started. On `lpar2b` HA instance, it will be started but on port 28544.

### YAML configurations - certificate

In Zowe YAML configuration, certificate definition shares the same format and this format can be used in several configuration entries. For example, `zowe.certificate`, `components.<component>.certificate`, and `haInstances.<ha-instance>.components.<component>.certificate`. The certificate definition may include the following entries:

- **`keystore.type`**  
 Defines the type of the keystore. If you are using keystore, this value usually should be `PKCS12`. If you are using keyring, this value should be `JCERACFKS`.
- **`keystore.file`**  
 Defines the path of the keystore file. If you are using keyring, this should look like `safkeyring://<keyring-owner>/<keyring-name>`. For example, `safkeyring://ZWESVUSR/ZoweKeyring`.
- **`keystore.password`**  
 Defines the password of the keystore.
- **`keystore.alias`**  
 Represents the alias name of the certificate stored in keystore. If you are using keyring, this is the certificate label connected to the keyring.
- **`truststore.type`**  
 Defines the type of the truststore file. If you are using keystore, this value usually should be `PKCS12`. If you are using keyring, this value should be `JCERACFKS`.
- **`truststore.file`**  
 Defines the path to the truststore file. If you are using keyring, this should look like `safkeyring://<keyring-owner>/<keyring-name>`, usually will be the same value of `keystore.file`.
- **`truststore.password`**  
 Defines the password of the truststore.
- **`pem.key`**  
 Defines the private key file in PEM format. This can be used by applications that do not support either PKCS12 keystore format or z/OS keyring.
- **`pem.certificate`**  
 Defines the public key file in PEM format. This can be used by applications that do not support either PKCS12 keystore format or z/OS keyring.
- **`pem.certificateAuthorities`**  
 Defines certificate authorities in PEM format. This can be used by applications that do not support either PKCS12 keystore format or z/OS keyring.

### YAML configurations - zowe

The high-level configuration `zowe` supports these definitions:

#### Directories

- **`zowe.runtimeDirectory`**  
 Tells Zowe the runtime directory where it's installed.
- **`zowe.logDirectory`**  
 Some Zowe components write logs to file system. This tells Zowe which directory should be used to store log files.
- **`zowe.workspaceDirectory`**
 Tells Zowe components where they can write temporary runtime files.
- **`zowe.extensionDirectory`**  
 Tells Zowe where you put the runtime of all your extensions.

 #### Zowe Job

- **`zowe.job.name`**  
 Defines the Zowe job name for the ZWESLSTC started task.
- **`zowe.job.prefix`**  
 Defines the Zowe address space prefix for Zowe components.

#### Domain and port to access Zowe

- **`zowe.externalDomains`**  
 Defines a list of external domains that will be used by the Zowe instance. This configuration is an array of domain name strings.
 In Sysplex deployment, this is the DVIPA domain name defined in Sysplex Distributor. For example,
   
   ```yaml
   zowe:
    externalDomains:
    - external.my-company.com
    - additional-dvipa-domain.my-company.com
   ```
 In Kubernetes deployment, this is the domain name you will use to access your Zowe running in Kubernetes cluster.
- **`zowe.externalPort`**  
 Defines the port that will be exposed to external Zowe users. By default, this value is set based on Zowe APIML Gateway port.
 In Sysplex deployment, this is the DVIPA port defined in Sysplex Distributor. See [Configure Sysplex Distributor](../user-guide/configure-sysplex.md#configuring-sysplex-distributor) for more information.
 In Kubernetes deployment, this is the gateway Service port will be exposed to external.

#### Extra environment variables

- **`zowe.environments`**  
 Defines extra environment variables to customize the Zowe runtime. This configuration is a list of key / value pairs.
 **Example:**

   ```yaml
   zowe:
    environments:
      MY_NEW_ENV: value-of-my-env
   ```
 Please be aware that variables defined here are global to all Zowe components, on all HA instances.

 An example use case is to override system-wide environment variables for the Zowe runtime, such as the directory to use for temporary files.

#### Certificate

- **`zowe.certificate`**  
 Defines the northbound certificate facing Zowe users.
- **`zowe.verifyCertificates`**
  Defines how Zowe should validate the certificates used by components or external service(s) like z/OSMF. It can be a value of:
  * `STRICT`: This is the default value. Zowe will validate if the certificate is trusted in our trust store and if the certificate Command Name and Subject Alternative Name (SAN)is validated. This is recommended for the best security.
  * `NONSTRICT`: Zowe will validate if the certificate is trusted in our trust store. In this mode, Zowe does not validate certificate Common Name and Subject Alternative Name (SAN). This option does not have the best security but allows you to try out Zowe when you don't have permission to fix certificate used by external services like z/OSMF.
  * `DISABLED`: This will disable certificate validation completely. This is **NOT** recommended for security purpose.

#### Launcher and launch scripts

Launcher is the program behind `ZWESLSTC` started task.

- **`zowe.launcher`**  
 The launcher section defines defaults about how the Zowe launcher should act upon components.
- **`zowe.launcher.restartIntervals`**  
 An array of positive integers that defines how many times a component should be tried to be restarted if it fails, and how much time to wait in seconds for that restart to succeed before retrying.
- **`zowe.launcher.minUptime`**  
 The minimum amount of time a zowe component should be running in order to be declared as started successfully.
- **`zowe.launcher.shareAs`**  
 Whether or not the launcher should start components in the same address space as it. See documentation for [_BPX_SHAREAS](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.4.0?topic=shell-setting-bpx-shareas-bpx-spawn-script) for details.
- **`zowe.launchScript.logLevel`**
 You can set it to `debug` or `trace` to enable different level of debug messages from Zowe launch scripts. This may help to troubleshoot issues during Zowe start.

#### Setup

Zowe YAML configuration uses `zowe.setup` section to instruct how Zowe should be installed and configured. This section is optional for Zowe runtime but only be used for `zwe install` and `zwe init` commands.

```yaml

If you are using `JCERACFKS` certificate, this should be certificate labels on the z/OS system.

**For `PKCS12` certificate users,**

- `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12.directory` is the directory where you plan to store the PKCS12 keystore and truststore. This is required if `zowe.setup.certificate.type` is `PKCS12`.
- `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12.lock` is a boolean configuration to tell if we should lock the PKCS12 keystore directory only for Zowe runtime user and group. The default value is true.
- You can also define `name`, `password`, `caAlias` and `caPassword` under `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12` to customized keystore and truststore. These configurations are optional, but it is recommended to update them from default values.
- Define `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12.import.keystore` if you already acquired certificate from other CA, stored them in PKCS12 format, and want to import into Zowe PKCS12 keystore.

- If you want to let Zowe to generate a new certificate:
  * You can also customize `label` and `caLabel` under `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring` if you want to generate new certificate. The default value of `label` is `localhost` and default value of `caLabel` is `localca`.
- If you want to import a certificate stored in MVS data set into Zowe keyring:
  * `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.connect.dsName` is required in this case. It tells Zowe the data set where the certificate stored.
  * `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.connect.password` is the password when importing the certificate.
  * The certificate will be imported with the label defined in `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.label`.
- If you want to connect an existing certificate into a Zowe keyring:
  * `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.connect.user` is required and tells Zowe the owner of existing certificate. This field can have value of `SITE`.
  * `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.connect.label` is also required and tells Zowe the label of existing certificate.
- If `zowe.verifyCertificates` is not `DISABLED`, and z/OSMF host (`zOSMF.host`) is provided, Zowe will try to trust the z/OSMF certificate.
  * If you are using `RACF` security manager, Zowe will try to automatically detect the z/OSMF CA based on certificate owner specified by
    `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.zOSMF.user`. Default value of this field is `IZUSVR`. If the automatic detection failed, you will need to define `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.zOSMF.ca` indicates what is the label of the z/OSMF root certificate authority.
  * If you are using `ACF2` or `TSS` (Top Secret) security manager, `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.zOSMF.ca` is required to indicates what is the label of the z/OSMF root certificate authority.

### YAML configurations - java

The high-level configuration `java` supports these definitions:

- **`home`**  
 Defines the path to the Java runtime directory.

### YAML configurations - node

The high-level configuration `node` supports these definitions:

- **`home`**  
 Defines the path to the Node.js runtime directory.

### YAML configurations - zOSMF

The high-level configuration `zOSMF` supports these definitions:

- **`zOSMF.host`**  
 Defines the hostname of your z/OSMF instance.
- **`zOSMF.port`**  
 Defines the port of your z/OSMF instance.
- **`zOSMF.applId`**  
 Defines the application ID of your z/OSMF instance.

### YAML configurations - components

All Zowe components and extensions can have a dedicated section under the `components` high-level configuration.

In this section, `<component>` represents any Zowe components or extensions. For all components and extensions, these are the common definitions.

- **`components.<component>.enabled`**  
 Defines if you want to start this component in this Zowe instance. This allows you to control each component instead of a group.
- **`components.<component>.certificate`**  
 You can customize a component to use different certificate from default values. This section follows same format defined in [YAML configurations - certificate](#yaml-configurations-certificate). If this is not customized, the component will use certificates defined in `zowe.certificate`.
- **`components.<component>.launcher`**  
 Any component can have a launcher section which overrides the overall Zowe Launcher default defined in `zowe.launcher`.

#### Configure component gateway

These configurations can be used under the `components.gateway` section:

- **`port`**  
 Defines the port which the gateway should be started on. This must be a valid port number.
- **`debug`**  
 Defines whether to enable debug mode for the Gateway.
- **`apiml.service.allowEncodedSlashes`**  
 When this parameter is set to `true`, the Gateway allows encoded characters to be part of URL requests redirected through the Gateway. 
- **`apiml.service.corsEnabled`**  
 When this parameter is set to `true`, CORS are enabled in the API Gateway for Gateway routes `gateway/api/v1/**`.
- **`apiml.service.preferIpAddress`**  
 Set this parameter to `true`  to advertise a service IP address instead of its hostname. **Note:** This configuration is deprecated. Zowe start script will ignore this value and always set it to `false`.
- **`apiml.gateway.timeoutMillis`**  
 Specifies the timeout for connection to the services in milliseconds.
- **`apiml.security.x509.enabled`**  
 Set this parameter to `true` to enable the client certificate authentication functionality through ZSS.
- **`apiml.security.x509.externalMapperUrl`**  
 Defines the URL where Gateway can query the mapping of client certificates.
- **`apiml.security.auth.provider`**  
 Defines the authentication provider used by the API Gateway.
- **`apiml.security.authorization.endpoint.url`**  
 Defines the URL to the authorization endpoint. This endpoint tells Gateway if a user has a particular permission on SAF profile. For example, permission to the `APIML.SERVICES` profile of `ZOWE` class.
- **`apiml.security.ssl.verifySslCertificatesOfServices`**  
 Defines whether APIML should verify certificates of services in strict mode. Setting to `true` will enable the `strict` mode where APIML will validate if the certificate is trusted in turststore, and also if the certificate Common Name or Subject Alternate Name (SAN) matches the service hostname.
- **`apiml.security.ssl.nonStrictVerifySslCertificatesOfServices`**  
 Defines whether APIML should verify certificates of services in non-strict mode. Setting the value to `true` will enable the `non-strict` mode where APIML will validate if the certificate is trusted in turststore, but ignore the certificate Common Name or Subject Alternate Name (SAN) check. Zowe will ignore this configuration when strict mode is enabled with `apiml.security.ssl.verifySslCertificatesOfServices`.
- **`apiml.server.maxConnectionsPerRoute`**  
 Specifies the maximum connections for each service.
- **`apiml.server.maxTotalConnections`**  
 Specifies the total connections for all services registered under API Mediation Layer.

#### Configure component discovery

These configurations can be used under the `components.discovery` section:

- **`port`**  
 Defines the port which discovery should be started on. This may be defined as a valid port number or as an offset from the Gateway component's port. To define an offset enter `"+{offset}"` or `"-{offset}"` as a string. The offset must start with `+` or `-`.
- **`debug`**  
 Defines whether to enable debug mode for the Discovery Service.
- **`apiml.service.preferIpAddress`**  
 Set this parameter to `true`  to advertise a service IP address instead of its hostname. **Note:** This configuration is deprecated. The Zowe start script will ignore this value and always set it to `false`.
- **`apiml.security.ssl.verifySslCertificatesOfServices`**  
 Defines whether APIML should verify certificates of services in strict mode. Setting to `true` will enable the `strict` mode where APIML will validate both if the certificate is trusted in turststore, and also if the certificate Common Name or Subject Alternate Name (SAN) matches the service hostname.
- **`apiml.security.ssl.nonStrictVerifySslCertificatesOfServices`**  
 Defines whether APIML should verify certificates of services in non-strict mode. Setting to `true` will enable the `non-strict` mode where APIML will validate if the certificate is trusted in turststore, but ignore the certificate Common Name or Subject Alternate Name (SAN) check. Zowe will ignore this configuration if strict mode is enabled with `apiml.security.ssl.verifySslCertificatesOfServices`.
- **`alternativeStaticApiDefinitionsDirectories`**  
 Specifies the alternative directories of static definitions.
- **`apiml.server.maxTotalConnections`**  
 Specifies the total connections for all services registered under API Mediation Layer.
- **`apiml.discovery.serviceIdPrefixReplacer`**  
 Modifies the service ID of a service instance before it registers to API Mediation Layer.
 Using this parameter ensures compatibility of services that use a non-conformant organization prefix with v2, based on Zowe v2 conformance.


#### Configure component api-catalog

These configurations can be used under the `components.api-catalog` section:

- **`port`**

 Set this parameter to `true`  to advertise a service IP address instead of its hostname.  
  **Note:** This configuration is deprecated. Zowe start script will ignore this value and always set it to `false`.

#### Configure component caching-service

These configurations can be used under the `components.caching-service` section:

- **`port`**  
 Defines the port which Caching Service should be started on. This may be defined as a valid port number or as an offset from the Gateway component's port. To define an offset enter `"+{offset}"` or `"-{offset}"` as a string. The offset must start with `+` or `-`.

```yaml
components:
  # for extensions, you can add your definition like this
  my-extension:
    enabled: true
```

### YAML configurations - haInstances

All Zowe high availability instances should have a dedicated section under the `haInstances` high-level configuration.

In this section, `<ha-instance>` represents any Zowe high availability instance ID.

For all high availability instances, these are the common definitions.

- **`haInstances.<ha-instance>.hostname`**  
 Defines the host name where you want to start this instance. This could be the host name of one LPAR in your Sysplex.
- **`haInstances.<ha-instance>.sysname`**  
 Defines the system name of the LPAR where the instance is running. Zowe will use `ROUTE` command to send JES2 start or stop command to this HA instance.
- **`haInstances.<ha-instance>.components.<component>`**  
 Optional settings you can override component configurations for this high availability instance. See [Configuration override](#configuration-override) for more details.

### Auto-generated environment variables

Each line of Zowe YAML configuration will have a matching environment variable during runtime. This is converted based on pre-defined pattern:

- All configurations under `zowe`, `components`, `haInstances` will be converted to a variable with name:
  * prefixed with `ZWE_`,
  * any non-alphabetic-numeric characters will be converted to underscore `_`,
  * and no double underscores like `__`.
- Calculated configurations of `haInstance`, which is portion of `haInstances.<current-ha-instance>` will be converted same way.
- Calculated configurations of `configs`, which is portion of `haInstances.<current-ha-instance>.components.<current-component>` will be converted same way.
- All other configuration entries will be converted to a variable with name:
  * all upper cases,
  * any non-alphabetic-numeric characters will be converted to underscore `_`,
  * and no double underscores like `__`.

For examples:

- `ZWE_zowe_runtimeDirectory`, parent directory of where `zwe` server command is located.
- `ZWE_zowe_workspaceDirectory` is the path of user customized workspace directory.
- `ZWE_zowe_setup_dataset_prefix` is the high-level qualifier where Zowe MVS data sets are installed.
- `ZWE_zowe_setup_dataset_parmlib` is the data set configured to store customized version of parameter library members.
- `ZWE_zowe_setup_dataset_authPluginLib` is the data set configured to store APF authorized ZIS plug-ins load library.
- `ZWE_zowe_setup_security_users_zowe` is the name of Zowe runtime user.
- `ZWE_configs_port` is your component port number you can use in your start script. It points to the value of `haInstances.<current-ha-instance>.components.<your-component>.port`, or fall back to `components.<my-component>.port`, or fall back to `configs.port` defined in your component manifest.

### Troubleshooting your YAML with the Red Hat VS Code extension

After you download the Red Hat VSCode extension for YAML, YAML validation for your files is turned on by default. Syntax mistakes are highlighted in red. To parse sensitive information, we would highly recommend leaving the data gathering option disabled. To customize your settings, click on the "Extensions" category in VS Code left-hand side workspace, scroll down to YAML Language Support by Red Hat, and click on the gear icon and select "Extension Settings".
