# Zowe YAML server configuration file reference

Zowe v3 uses a YAML configuration file for server installation, configuration, and runtime. This file is usually referred to as the Zowe configuration YAML file or the `zowe.yaml` file. YAML is a human-friendly data serialization language for all programming languages. To learn more about YAML specifications, see [https://yaml.org/](https://yaml.org/). For a free, offline YAML validator to help validate your syntax, download the [Red Hat's VS Code YAML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml).

Content within the YAML file is documented by and validated against schema files which are shipped within Zowe and extended by Zowe extensions.
For details on the schema technology and where to find the schema files within our source code, see [Using the Configuration Manager](../user-guide/configmgr-using.md#json-schema-validation).

:::note

In the following sections, we refer to configuration keys by using the concatenation of key names and dots. For example, if you want to update the configuration key `zowe.certificate.keystore.type` with the value `PKCS12`, you should set the value for this entry in the `zowe.yaml`:

```yaml
zowe:
  certificate:
    keystore:
      type: PKCS12
```

### High-level overview of YAML configuration file

The YAML configuration file has few high-level sections:

- **zowe**  
 Defines global configurations specific to Zowe, including default values.
- **java**  
 Defines Java configurations used by Zowe components.
- **node**  
 Defines node.js configurations used by Zowe components.
- **zOSMF**  
 Tells Zowe your z/OSMF configurations.
- **components**  
 Defines detailed configurations for each Zowe component or extension. Each component or extension may have a key entry under this section. For example, `components.gateway` is the configuration for the API Mediation Layer Gateway service.
- **haInstances**  
 Defines customized configurations for each High Availability (HA) instance. You should predefine all Zowe HA instances you want to start within your Sysplex.

### Extract sharable configuration out of zowe.yaml

The Zowe YAML configuration file supports splitting into several files or PARMLIB members. This can help simplify grouping configuration changes by type or owner.
For details, see [Splitting configuration into multiple storage types](../user-guide/configmgr-using.md#splitting-configuration-into-multiple-storage-types).

### Creating portable references

The Zowe YAML configuration file has template logic for relating one value to another, a system environment variable or symbol, and the possibility to add conditional behavior.
This template logic can help to make your configuration portable between systems that need slightly different behavior while retaining the same configuration file.
For details, see [Configuration templates](../user-guide/configmgr-using.md#configuration-templates) in the article _Zowe Configuration Manager_.

### Configuration override - defaults.yaml

Values for global configuration and components are defined in the [`defaults.yaml`](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/blame/v3.x/master/files/defaults.yaml) file. This file is always merged with current `configs` when `configmgr` is used.

For example, if you decide to remove the `zowe.job` section by commenting or deleting, the `zowe.job` section reappears  after merging with the defaults. 

**Example of initial user config:**

  ```yaml
  zowe:
    job:
    # Zowe JES job name
      name: ZW3SV1
    # Prefix of component address space
      prefix: ZW31
  ```
**Example of modified user config - `zowe.job` commented out:**

  ```yaml
  zowe:
    # job:
    # Zowe JES job name
    # name: ZW3SV1
    # Prefix of component address space
    # prefix: ZW31
  ```

**Example of merged result:**

  ```yaml
  zowe:
    job:
      name: ZWE1SV
      prefix: ZWE1
  ```
:::note
To disable a component which is defined enabled in [`defaults.yaml`](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/blame/v3.x/master/files/defaults.yaml), ensure that you have a definition of that component in your config, and change `enabled: true` to `enabled: false`. Deleting or commenting out a component does not disable the component.
:::

### Configuration override - inside zowe.yaml

In the `zowe.yaml`, you can define default values which can be overridden in more granular level configurations. This can happen in several ways:

- The component can override the default certificate configuration. For the specific entry of certification configuration that is not overridden, the configuration falls back to default configurations.  
<!-- Is the following example and example of the user modified configuration? -->
**Example:**

  ```yaml
  zowe:
    certificate:
      keystore:
        type: PKCS12
        file: /global/zowe/keystore/localhost/localhost.keystore.p12
        password: password
        alias: localhost
      truststore:
        type: PKCS12
        file: /global/zowe/keystore/localhost/localhost.truststore.p12
        password: password
      pem:
        key: /global/zowe/keystore/localhost/localhost.key
        certificate: /global/zowe/keystore/localhost/localhost.cer
        certificateAuthorities: /global/zowe/keystore/local_ca/local_ca.cer
  components:
    app-server:
      certificate:
        keystore:
          alias: app-server
        pem:
          key: /global/zowe/keystore/localhost/app-server.key
          certificate: /global/zowe/keystore/localhost/app-server.cer
  ```
  In this example, the App Server usees the certificate alias `app-server` instead of `localhost` from the same keystore defined in `zowe.certificate.keystore.file`. Note that the service uses the same truststore defined in `zowe.certificate.truststore.file`.

- Zowe high availability (HA) instance component configuration `haInstances.<ha-instance>.components.<component>` can override global level component configurations `components.<component>`. Any configuration  in the `components.<component>` level can be overridden in the `haInstances.<ha-instance>.components.<component>` level. 

**Example:**

  ```yaml
  components:
    app-server:
      enabled: true
      port: 8544
  haInstances:
    lpar2a:
      components:
        app-server:
          enabled: false
    lpar2b:
      components:
        app-server:
          port: 28544
  ```
  
  In this example configuration, the App Server on `lpar2a` HA instance will not be started. On `lpar2b` HA instance, it will be started but on port 28544.

### YAML configurations - certificate

In Zowe YAML configuration, the certificate definition shares the same format which can be used in several configuration entries. For example, `zowe.certificate`, `components.<component>.certificate`, and `haInstances.<ha-instance>.components.<component>.certificate`. The certificate definition may include the following entries:

- **keystore.type**  
 Specifies the type of the keystore. If you are using keystore, this value usually should be `PKCS12`. If you are using keyring, this value should be `JCERACFKS`.
- **keystore.file**  
 Specifies the path of the keystore file. If you are using keyring, this should look like `safkeyring://<keyring-owner>/<keyring-name>`. For example, `safkeyring://ZWESVUSR/ZoweKeyring`.
- **keystore.password**  
 Specifies the password of the keystore.
- **keystore.alias**  
 Represents the alias name of the certificate stored in keystore. If you are using keyring, this is the certificate label connected to the keyring.
- **truststore.type**  
 Specifies the type of the truststore file. If you are using keystore, this value usually should be `PKCS12`. If you are using keyring, this value should be `JCERACFKS`.
- **truststore.file**  
 Specifies the path to the truststore file. If you are using keyring, this should look like `safkeyring://<keyring-owner>/<keyring-name>`, and usually will be the same value of `keystore.file`.
- **truststore.password**  
 Specifies the password of the truststore.
- **pem.key**  
 Specifies the private key file in PEM format. This can be used by applications that do not support either PKCS12 keystore format or z/OS keyring.
- **pem.certificate**  
 Specifies the public key file in PEM format. This can be used by applications that do not support either PKCS12 keystore format or a z/OS keyring.
- **pem.certificateAuthorities**  
 Specifies certificate authorities in PEM format. This can be used by applications that do not support either PKCS12 keystore format or a z/OS keyring.

### YAML configurations - zowe

The high-level configuration `zowe` supports these definitions:

#### Directories

- **zowe.runtimeDirectory**  
 Specifies the runtime directory where Zowe is installed.
- **zowe.logDirectory**  
 Some Zowe components write logs to file system. This parameter specifies which directory should be used to store log files.
- **zowe.workspaceDirectory**  
 Specifies components where they can write temporary runtime files.
- **zowe.extensionDirectory**  
 Specifies the location of the runtime of all your extensions.

 #### Zowe Job

- **zowe.job.name**  
 Specifies the Zowe job name for the ZWESLSTC started task.
- **zowe.job.prefix**  
 Specifies the Zowe address space prefix for Zowe components.

#### Domain and port to access Zowe

- **zowe.externalDomains**  
 Specifies a list of external domains to be used by the Zowe instance. This configuration is an array of domain name strings.
 In Sysplex deployment, this value is the DVIPA domain name defined in Sysplex Distributor. For example,
   
   ```yaml
   zowe:
    externalDomains:
    - external.my-company.com
    - additional-dvipa-domain.my-company.com
   ```
 In Kubernetes deployment, this value is the domain name you will use to access your Zowe running in a Kubernetes cluster.
- **zowe.externalPort**  
 Specifies the port that is to be exposed to external Zowe users. By default, this value is set based on Zowe APIML Gateway port.
 In Sysplex deployment, this is the DVIPA port defined in Sysplex Distributor. For more information, see [Configure Sysplex Distributor](../user-guide/configure-sysplex.md#configuring-sysplex-distributor). 
 In Kubernetes deployment, this value is the Gateway Service port to be exposed externally.

#### Extra environment variables

- **zowe.environments**  
 Defines extra environment variables to customize the Zowe runtime. This configuration is a list of key / value pairs.
 **Example:**

   ```yaml
   zowe:
    environments:
      MY_NEW_ENV: value-of-my-env
   ```
 
 :::note
 Variables defined here are global to all Zowe components, on all HA instances.

 An example use case is to override system-wide environment variables for the Zowe runtime, such as the directory to use for temporary files.
 :::

#### Certificate

- **zowe.certificate**  
 Specifies the northbound certificate facing Zowe users.
- **zowe.verifyCertificates**
  Specifies how Zowe is to validate the certificates used by components or external service(s) like z/OSMF.  
   **Possible values:**
  * `STRICT`: This is the default value. Zowe validates if the certificate is trusted in Zowe's trust store and if the certificate Command Name and Subject Alternative Name (SAN) is validated. This is recommended for the best security.
  * `NONSTRICT`: Zowe validates if the certificate is trusted in Zowe's trust store. In this mode, Zowe does not validate certificate Common Name and Subject Alternative Name (SAN). This option does not have the highest security level but allows you to try out Zowe when you do not have permission to fix the certificate used by external services like z/OSMF.
  * `DISABLED`: This value disables certificate validation completely. This is **NOT** recommended for security purpose.

#### Launcher and launch scripts

Launcher is the program behind the `ZWESLSTC` started task.

- **zowe.launcher**  
 The launcher section defines defaults about how the Zowe launcher acts on components.
- **zowe.launcher.restartIntervals**  
 An array of positive integers that defines how many times a component attempts to be restarted if it fails, and how much time to wait in seconds for that restart to succeed before retrying.
- **zowe.launcher.minUptime**  
 Specifies the minimum amount of time a Zowe component should be running in order to be declared as started successfully.
- **zowe.launcher.shareAs**  
 Specifies if the launcher should start components in the same address space. See documentation for [_BPX_SHAREAS](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.4.0?topic=shell-setting-bpx-shareas-bpx-spawn-script) for details.
- **zowe.launchScript.logLevel**
 Set to `debug` or `trace` to enable different levels of debug messages from Zowe launch scripts. This setting may help troubleshoot issues during Zowe start.

#### Setup

Zowe YAML configuration uses the `zowe.setup` section to instruct how Zowe should be installed and configured. This section is optional for Zowe runtime and only applies to `zwe install` and `zwe init` commands.

```yaml

### YAML configurations - java

The high-level configuration `java` supports these definitions:

- **home**  
 Specifies the path to the Java runtime directory.

### YAML configurations - node

The high-level configuration `node` supports these definitions:

- **home**  
 Specifies the path to the Node.js runtime directory.

:::tip
Ensure the value of `node.home` in the `zowe.yaml` is visible to the Zowe STC users, and contains `bin/node`.
**Example:**
```
node:
  home: "/usrlppSysplex/nodejs/node-v18.18.2"
```
This value is valid only when the path `/usrlppSysplex/nodejs/node-v18.18.2/bin/node` exists. If you observe output of `node:...FSUM7351 not found`, check that the value contains `bin/node`.
:::

### YAML configurations - zOSMF

The high-level configuration `zOSMF` supports the following definitions:

- **zOSMF.host**  
 Specifies the hostname of your z/OSMF instance.
- **zOSMF.port**  
 Specifies the port of your z/OSMF instance.
- **zOSMF.applId**  
 Specifies the application ID of your z/OSMF instance.

### YAML configurations - components

All Zowe components and extensions can have a dedicated section under the `components` high-level configuration.

In this section, _`<component>`_ represents any Zowe components or extension. For all components and extensions, the following parameters are the common definitions:

- **components.<_component_>.enabled**  
Specifies if the component should be started in this Zowe instance, thereby providing control over each component instead of a group.
- **components.<_component_>.certificate**  
 Allows for customization for a component to use a different certificate from default values. This section follows the same format defined in [YAML configurations - certificate](#yaml-configurations---certificate). If this parameter is not customized, the component uses certificates defined in `zowe.certificate`.
- **components.<_component_>.launcher**  
 Specifies if a specific component has a launcher section which overrides the overall Zowe Launcher default defined in `zowe.launcher`.

#### Configure component gateway

These configurations can be used under the `components.gateway` section:

- **port**  
 Specifies the port which the Gateway should start on. This value must be a valid port number.
- **debug**  
 Specifies the enablement of debug mode for the Gateway.
- **apiml.connectionTimeout**
  Specifies the value in milliseconds which corresponds to the period in which API ML should establish a single, non-managed connection with the service. If omitted, the default value specified in the API ML Gateway service configuration is used.
- **apiml.connection.idleConnectionTimeoutSeconds**  
  Specifies how long the connection to southbound remains open without communication. The default value is 5 seconds. The unit is in seconds.
- **apiml.health.protected**  
  Specifies if the health check endpoint is accessible with or without authentication.  
- **apiml.gateway.timeoutMillis**  
 Specifies the timeout for the connection to the services in milliseconds.
- **apiml.security.x509.enabled**  
 Specifies if client certificate authentication functionality through ZSS is enabled. Set this parameter to `true` to enable the client certificate authentication functionality through ZSS.
- **apiml.security.x509.externalMapperUrl**  
 Specifies the URL where the Gateway can query the mapping of client certificates.
- **apiml.security.auth.jwt.customAuthHeader**  
 Provides a valid JWT for the southbound service in the custom header. A valid value is any valid name for an HTTP header. 
- **apiml.security.auth.passticket.customAuthHeader**  
 Provides PassTickets for the southbound service in the custom header. A valid value is any valid name for an HTTP header.
- **apiml.security.auth.passticket.customUserHeader**  
 Provides User Info when a PassTicket is provided in the custom header. A valid value is any valid name for an HTTP header.
- **apiml.security.auth.provider**  
 Specifies the authentication provider used by the API Gateway. Valid options are `saf` or `zosmf`.
- **apiml.security.auth.zosmf.serviceId**  
 Allows customization of the service id in case `zosmf` is specified as an authentication provider. The default value is `ibmzosmf`
- **apiml.security.auth.zosmf.jwtAutoconfiguration**  
 Customizes the behavior of the Gateway with respect to how JWTs are produced. Valid options are `jwt` and `ltpa`.  `jwt` is the default option. `ltpa` allows the API ML to produce JWTs instead of the z/OSMF service. `jwt` is the default and recommended option. 
- **apiml.security.authorization.endpoint.url**  
  Specifies the URL to the authorization endpoint. This endpoint informs the Gateway if a user has a particular permission on SAF profile, such as permission to the `APIML.SERVICES` profile of the `ZOWE` class.
- **apiml.security.personalAccessToken.enabled**  
  Specifies if Personal Access Tokens are enabled. The default value is `false`.  
- **apiml.security.useInternalMapper**  
  This property is a global feature toggle. Set the value to `true` to enable the Internal Mapper. The default value is `true`.
- **apiml.security.oidc.enabled**  
  Specifies the global feature toggle. Set the value to `true` to enable OIDC authentication functionality.
- **apiml.security.oidc.registry**  
  Specifies the SAF registry used to group identities recognized as having an OIDC identity mapping. The registry name is the string used during the creation of the mapping between distributed and mainframe user identities. For more information, see [ESM configuration prerequisites](../extend/extend-apiml/api-mediation-oidc-authentication.md#esm-configuration-prerequisites).
- **apiml.security.oidc.jwks.uri**  
  Specifies the URI obtained from the authorization server's metadata where the Gateway queries for the JWK used to sign and verify the access tokens. A valid value is any valid URI.
- **apiml.security.oidc.jwks.refreshInternalHours**  
  Specifies the frequency in hours to refresh the JWK keys from the OIDC provider. Defaults to one hour.
- **apiml.security.oidc.identityMapperUser**  
  (Optional) If the userId is different from the default Zowe runtime userId (`ZWESVUSR`), specify the `identityMapperUser` userId to configure API ML access to the external user identity mapper.

:::note

User authorization is required to use the `IRR.RUSERMAP` resource within the `FACILITY` class. The default value is `ZWESVUSR`. Permissions are set up during installation with the `ZWESECUR` JCL or workflow. To authenticate to the mapping API, a JWT is sent with the request. The token represents the user that is configured with this property.

:::

- **apiml.security.oidc.identityMapperUrl**  
 Specifies the URL where the Gateway can query the mapping of the distributed user ID to the mainframe user ID. 
  This property informs the Gateway about the location of this API. ZSS is the default API provider in Zowe. Note that if you are using Zowe release 2.14 or a later version, we recommend you use the [API ML internal mapper](../user-guide/api-mediation/configuration-client-certificates.md#configure-internal-api-ml-mapper). To provide your own API to perform the mapping, it is necessary to customize this value.

  The following URL is the default value for Zowe and ZSS:

    ```
    https://${ZWE_haInstance_hostname}:${GATEWAY_PORT}/zss/api/v1/certificate/dn
    ```
- **apiml.security.ssl.verifySslCertificatesOfServices**  
 Specifies if API ML is used to verify certificates of services in strict mode. Setting to `true` enables `strict` mode where API ML validates if the certificate is trusted in the truststore, and also if the certificate Common Name or Subject Alternate Name (SAN) matches the service hostname.
- **apiml.security.ssl.nonStrictVerifySslCertificatesOfServices**  
 Specifies if API ML is used to verify certificates of services in non-strict mode. Setting the value to `true` enables the `non-strict` mode where API ML validates if the certificate is trusted in the truststore, but ignores the certificate Common Name or Subject Alternate Name (SAN) check. Zowe ignores this configuration when `strict` mode is enabled with `apiml.security.ssl.verifySslCertificatesOfServices`.
- **apiml.service.allowEncodedSlashes**  
 Specifies if the Gateway allows encoded characters to be part of URL requests redirected through the Gateway. Set to `true` to allow encoded characters to be part of URL requests. 
- **apiml.service.corsEnabled**  
 Specifies if CORS are enabled in the API Gateway for Gateway routes `gateway/api/v1/**`. Set to `true` to enable CORS.
- **server.maxConnectionsPerRoute**  
  Specifies the maximum connections for each service.
- **server.maxTotalConnections**  
  Specifies the total connections for all services registered under API Mediation Layer.
- **server.ssl.enabled**  
  Specifies if TLS is used

  This timeout handles how long the Websocket connection remains open if there is no communication happening over the open connection. The default is one hour (3600000 milliseconds).
- **server.webSocket.connectTimeout**  
  This timeout limits how long the API Gateway waits until it drops connection if the Gateway cannot reach the target server. The default is 45 seconds (45000 milliseconds). 
- **server.webSocket.asyncWriteTimeout**  
  This timeout handles how long before the server fails with an unsuccessful response when trying to write a message to the Websocket connection. The default is 60 seconds (60000 milliseconds).
- **server.webSocket.requestBufferSize**  
  This property handles the maximum request size allowed in the WebSocket handshake requests. The default is 8K.


#### Configure component discovery

These configurations can be applied to the `components.discovery` section:

- **port**  
 Specifies the port which discovery is to be started on. This value may be a valid port number or an offset from the Gateway component's port. To define an offset enter `"+{offset}"` or `"-{offset}"` as a string. The offset must start with `+` or `-`.
- **debug**  
 Specifies the enablement of debug mode for the Discovery Service.

- **apiml.health.protected**  
  Specifies if the health check endpoint is accessible with or without authentication.

- **apiml.security.ssl.nonStrictVerifySslCertificatesOfServices**  
 Specifies if API ML is to verify certificates of services in `non-strict` mode. Set to `true` to enable the `non-strict` mode where API ML validates if the certificate is trusted in the truststore, but ignores the certificate Common Name or Subject Alternate Name (SAN) check. Zowe ignores this configuration if `strict` mode is enabled with `apiml.security.ssl.verifySslCertificatesOfServices`.
- **alternativeStaticApiDefinitionsDirectories**  
 Specifies the alternative directories of static definitions. A valid value is the list of directories separated by commas. 
- **apiml.server.maxTotalConnections**  
 Specifies the total number of connections for all services registered under API Mediation Layer.
- **apiml.discovery.serviceIdPrefixReplacer**  
 Modifies the service ID of a service instance before it registers to API Mediation Layer.
 Use this parameter to ensure compatibility of services that use a non-conformant organization prefix with v2, based on Zowe v2 conformance.
- **server.ssl.enabled**  
 Specifies if TLS is used. The default value is `true`.

The format is `${haInstance.hostname}[${components.caching-service.storage.infinispan.jgroups.port}]`. 
- **storage.infinispan.persistence.dataLocation**  
  The path where the Soft-Index store keeps its data files for the Infinispan Soft-Index Cache Store.
  The default value is `data`. If you run the Caching Service in Highly Available mode and the instances use the same filesystem, you have to specify a different value of the `CACHING_STORAGE_INFINISPAN_PERSISTENCE_DATALOCATION` property for each instance. For more information, see the [Soft-Index File Store](https://infinispan.org/blog/2014/10/31/soft-index-file-store).

#### Configure external extension

You can define a `components.<extension-id>` section and use common component configuration entries.

For example, enable `my-extension`:

```yaml
components:
  # for extensions, you can add your definition like this
  my-extension:
    enabled: true
```

### YAML configurations - haInstances

All Zowe high availability instances should have a dedicated section under the `haInstances` high-level configuration.

In this section, `<ha-instance>` represents any Zowe high availability instance ID.

For all high availability instances, these are the common definitions.

- **haInstances.<ha-instance>.hostname**  
 Specifies the host name where you want to start this instance. This value could be the host name of one LPAR in your Sysplex.
- **haInstances.<ha-instance>.sysname**  
 Specifies the system name of the LPAR where the instance is running. Zowe uses the `ROUTE` command to send JES2 start or stop command to this HA instance.
- **haInstances.<ha-instance>.components.<component>**  
 This optional settings allows you to override component configurations for this high availability instance. See [Configuration override - defaults.yaml](#configuration-override---defaultsyaml) for more details.

### Auto-generated environment variables

Each line of Zowe YAML configuration has a matching environment variable during runtime. This variable is converted based on a pre-defined pattern:

- All configurations under `zowe`, `components`, `haInstances` are converted to a variable with the name with the following conditiona:
  * prefixed with `ZWE_`
  * any non-alphabetic-numeric characters are converted to underscore (`_`)
  * no double underscores (`__`)
- Calculated configurations of `haInstance`, which is a portion of `haInstances.<current-ha-instance>` are converted the same way.
- Calculated configurations of `configs`, which is a portion of `haInstances.<current-ha-instance>.components.<current-component>` are converted the same way.
- All other configuration entries are converted to a variable with a name with the following conditions:
  * all upper cases
  * any non-alphabetic-numeric characters are converted to underscore (`_`)
  * no double underscores (`__`)

**Examples:**

- `ZWE_zowe_runtimeDirectory` is parent directory where `zwe` server command is located.
- `ZWE_zowe_workspaceDirectory` is the path of the user customized workspace directory.
- `ZWE_zowe_setup_dataset_prefix` is the high-level qualifier where Zowe MVS data sets are installed.
- `ZWE_zowe_setup_dataset_parmlib` is the data set configured to store customized version of parameter library members.
- `ZWE_zowe_setup_dataset_authPluginLib` is the data set configured to store APF authorized ZIS plug-ins load library.
- `ZWE_zowe_setup_security_users_zowe` is the name of Zowe runtime user.
- `ZWE_configs_port` is your component port number you can use in your start script. It points to the value of `haInstances.<current-ha-instance>.components.<your-component>.port`, or fall back to `components.<my-component>.port`, or fall back to `configs.port` defined in your component manifest.

### Troubleshooting your YAML with the Red Hat VS Code extension

After you download the Red Hat VSCode extension for YAML, YAML validation for your files is turned on by default. Syntax mistakes are highlighted in red. To parse sensitive information, we highly recommend leaving the data gathering option disabled. To customize your settings, click the "Extensions" category in VS Code left-hand side workspace, scroll down to YAML Language Support by Red Hat, and click the gear icon, and select "Extension Settings".
