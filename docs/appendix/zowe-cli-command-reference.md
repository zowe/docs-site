# Zowe CLI command reference guide

View detailed documentation on commands, actions, and options in Zowe CLI. You can read an interactive online version, download a PDF document, or download a ZIP file containing the HTML for the online version.

Currently, this reference documentation only contains the web help for 
the Zowe CLI core component and CLI plug-ins maintained by Zowe. As third-party plug-ins are approved under the Zowe V2 LTS Conformance Program and contribute their web help to Zowe, we will update the documentation accordingly. To view the web help for V1 conformant plug-ins, click the version drop-menu on the top right corner of this page and click the link to any previous v1.xx.x version of this page.
