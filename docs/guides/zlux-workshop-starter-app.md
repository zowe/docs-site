# Workshop starter App

This App is one of a two part tutorial on App building.
This is the starter App of the tutorial.
The App's scenario is that it has been opened to submit a task report to a set of users who can handle the task.
In this case, it is a bug report. We want to find engineers who can fix this bug, but this App does not hold a directory listing for engineers in the company, so we need to communicate with some App which does provide this information.
In this tutorial, you must build an App which is called by this App in order to list Engineers, is able to be filtered by the office that they work from, and is able to submit a list of engineers which would be able to handle the task.

You can work through the tutorial by completing the tasks in the README of the [workshop-user-browser-app](https://github.com/zowe/workshop-user-browser-app) repository.

This is a tutorial App intended to be done in a workshop session, where the user will develop through step-by-step guidance an App that communicates with a provided App to accomplish a simple App-to-App communication flow coded and visualized using modern web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, Typescript, Angular and the Zowe App Framework.
