## Modifying temporary file location settings

Change the default folder location where temporary files are stored:

   1. Navigate to Zowe Explorer settings.
   2. Under the data set, USS, or jobs settings that you want to edit, click the **Edit in settings.json** link.
   3. Modify the following definition in the file:

      ```json
        "zowe.files.temporaryDownloadsFolder.path": "/path/to/directory"
      ```

      Replace `/path/to/directory` with the new folder location.

    4. Save the file to keep the change.

## Modifying the `Secure Credentials Enabled` setting

When environment conditions do not support the Zowe CLI built-in credential manager, change the `Secure Credentials Enabled` setting:

 1. Navigate to Zowe Explorer settings.
 2. Scroll to **Security: Secure Credentials Enabled**.
 3. Deselect the checkbox to disable secure credentials.

    When disabled, if the `autoStore` setting in the `zowe.config.json` file is set to `true`, z/OS credentials are stored as text in the file.

    If the `autoStore` setting is set to `false`, you are prompted for the missing credentials in VS Code. The credentials are stored and used for the duration of the session.

## Setting confirmation requirements for submitting jobs

Submitting the wrong job can risk potential problems on your server. This can happen when the user enters the wrong job or inadvertently selects the **Submit Jobs** option.

To help prevent this, enable the option to require confirmation before submitting a job. Once enabled, a dialog window asking for user confirmation displays when **Submit Jobs** is selected.
