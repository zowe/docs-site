# Adding custom HTTP Auth headers to store user ID and PassTicket

If a southbound service needs to consume the PassTicket and the user ID from custom headers to participate in the Zowe SSO, you can define the custom HTTP headers names as part of the Gateway configuration.
The southbound service must use the `httpBasicPassTicket` scheme in order to leverage this functionality. Once the HTTP headers names are defined, each request to the southbound service contains the PassTicket and the user ID in the custom headers.

Use the following procedure to add the custom HTTP headers.

1. Open the file `zowe.yaml`.
2. Find or add the property `components.gateway.apiml.security.auth.passticket.customAuthHeader` and set the value which represents the header's name.
3. Find or add the property `components.gateway.apiml.security.auth.passticket.customUserHeader` and set the value which represents the header's name.
4. Restart Zowe.

Requests through the Gateway towards the southbound service now contain the custom HTTP headers with the PassTicket and the user ID.
