**Follow these steps:**
1.  Install the IBM MQ Plug-in for Zowe CLI.
2.  Create an MQ profile:

    ```
    zowe config init
    ```
3.  Set the port number to your MQ port:

    ```
    zowe config set profiles.mq.properties.port <port number>
    ```

You can now use your profile when you issue commands in the mq command group.
