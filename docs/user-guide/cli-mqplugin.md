# IBMÂ® MQ Plug-in for Zowe CLI

The IBM MQ Plug-in for Zowe CLI lets you issue MQSC commands to a queue manager. MQSC commands let you to perform administration tasks. For example, you can define, alter, or delete a local queue object.

**Note:** For more information about MQSC commands and the corresponding syntax, see [MQSC commands](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.1.0/com.ibm.mq.ref.adm.doc/q085130_.htm) on the IBM Knowledge Center.

## Use cases

You can use the plug-in to execute MQSC Commands. With MQSC commands you can manage queue manager objects (including the queue manager itself), queues, process definitions, channels, client connection channels, listeners, services, namelists, clusters, and authentication information objects.

## Using IBM MQ plug-in commands

For detailed documentation on commands, actions, and options available in this plug-in, see our Web Help. It is available for download in three formats: a PDF document, an interactive online version, and a ZIP file containing the HTML for the online version.

## Software requirements

Before you install the plug-in, meet the software requirements in [Software requirements for Zowe CLI plug-ins](cli-swreqplugins.md).

## Installing

Use one of the following methods to install or update the plug-in:

- [Installing plug-ins from an online registry](cli-installplugins.md#installing-plug-ins-from-an-online-registry)

- [Installing plug-ins from a local package](cli-installplugins.md#installing-plug-ins-from-a-local-package)

## Creating a user profile

You create an mq profile to avoid entering your connection details each time that you issue a command. You can create multiple profiles and switch between them as needed. Use one of the following methods to create a profile:

- **Create plug-in profiles using a configuration file:** Specify your profile and connection details in the `zowe.config.json` configuration file.

- **Create plug-in profiles using a command:** Issue the `zowe profiles create` command to create the profile.

We recommend that you create profiles using the configuration file. We do not recommend using profile commands because we are removing them in a future major release.


### Creating plug-in profiles using a configuration file

When you issue various zowe config commands, such as `init`, `auto-init`, and `convert-profiles`, they create a `zowe.config.json` configuration file. When you install the MQ plug-in, the commands create an entry for an `mq profile` in your `zowe.config.json` file.

Alternatively, you can create a mq profile manually by adding a section that contains the configuration details to your `zowe.config.json`ok configuration file.

1. Browse to the following directory `C:\Users\<username>\.zowe`

2. Open the `zowe.config.json` configuration file using a text editor or IDE, such as Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ. 

    **NOTE:** If the file does not exist, issue the following command to create the configuration file: `zowe config init --gc`

3. Add code to the "profiles" section as shown in the following example: 

    **Example:**
    ```
    "Your_mq_profile": {
        "type": "mq",
        "properties": {
            "host": "Your_host_name",
            "port": Your_port_number
        },
        "secure": [
            "user",
            "password"
        ]
    }
    ```
4. Save the file

You can now use your profile when you issue commands in the mq command group.

### Creating plug-in profiles using a command

The following steps describe how to create a profile using the `zowe profiles create` command.

1. Open a terminal window and issue the following command:

    ```
    zowe profiles create mq  <profile_name> --host <host> --port <port> --user <user> --password <password>
    ```

    **`profile_name`:**

    Specifies a name for your profile.

    **`host`:**

    Specifies the host name for the instance.

    **`user`:**

    Specifies your user name to log in to the instance.

    **`password`:**

    Specifies your password to log in to the instance.

    **`port`:**

    Specifies the port number to connect to the instance.

    **Example:**

    ```
    zowe profiles create mq-profile queue1 --host mq.zowe.org --port 1443 --user zowe --password zowepass
    ```

2. Press Enter. The result of the command displays as a success or failure message.

You can now use your profile when you issue commands in the mq command group.
