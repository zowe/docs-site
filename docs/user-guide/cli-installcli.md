### Installing Zowe CLI from a local package

If you do not have internet access at your site, use the following method to install Zowe CLI from a local package.

**Follow these steps:**

1. Address the following software requirements:

    - Install [Node.js V8.0 or higher LTS versions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

        **Tip:** You might need to restart the command prompt after installing Node.js. Issue the command `node --version` to verify that Node.js is installed.

    - Verify that you have **Node Package Manager (npm)** that is compatible with your version of Node.js. For a list of compatible versions, see [Node.js Previous Releases](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/).

        **Tip:** npm is included with the Node.js installation. Issue the command `npm --version` to verify the version of npm that is installed.

    - **(Optional)** If you plan to install plug-ins, review the [Software requirements for CLI plug-ins](cli-swreqplugins.md).

2. To obtain the installation files, navigate to [Zowe.org Downloads](https://zowe.org/#download) and click the **Zowe CLI** button.

   A file named `zowe-cli-package-v.r.m.zip` is downloaded to your computer.

    *where:*

    -  *v* indicates the version
    -  *r* indicates the release number
    -  *m* indicates the modification number

3. Unzip the contents of the `zowe-cli-package-v.r.m.zip` file to your preferred location on your computer.

4. Open a command-line window. Issue the following command against the extracted directory to install Zowe CLI on your computer:

    ```
    npm install -g zowe-cli.tgz
    ```

    **Note:** On Linux, you might need to prepend `sudo` to your `npm` commands so that you can issue the install and uninstall commands. For more information, see [Troubleshooting Zowe CLI](../troubleshoot/cli/troubleshoot-cli.md).

5. **(Optional)** Issue the following commands to install each available plug-in:

    ```
    zowe plugins install cics-for-zowe-cli.tgz
    ```

    ```
    zowe plugins install db2-for-zowe-cli.tgz
    ```

    ```
    zowe plugins install zos-ftp-for-zowe-cli.tgz
    ```

    ```
    zowe plugins install ims-for-zowe-cli.tgz
    ```

    ```
    zowe plugins install mq-for-zowe-cli.tgz
    ```

    ```
    zowe plugins install secure-credential-store-for-zowe-cli.tgz
    ```

    **Note:** The IBM Db2 plug-in requires [additional configuration](cli-db2plugin.md#installing).
