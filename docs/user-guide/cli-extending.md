# Extending Zowe CLI

You can install plug-ins to extend the capabilities of Zowe&trade; CLI. Plug-ins CLI to third-party applications are also available, such as Visual Studio Code Extension for Zowe (powered by Zowe CLI). Plug-ins add functionality to the product in the form of new command groups, actions, objects, and options. 

In addition to the contributed Zowe plug-ins, there are [Third-party Zowe Conformant Plug-ins](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/projects/zowe/conformance) available. 

**Important!** Plug-ins can gain control of your CLI application legitimately during the execution of every command. Install third-party plug-ins at your own risk. We make no warranties regarding the use of third-party plug-ins.
