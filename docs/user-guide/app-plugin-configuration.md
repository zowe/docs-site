# App plug-in configuration

The App framework will load plug-ins from components such as extensions based upon their enabled status in Zowe configuration. The server caches knowledge of these plug-ins in the `<workspaceDirectory>/app-server/plugins` folder. This location can be customized with the *components.app-server.pluginsDir* variable in the Zowe configuration file.
