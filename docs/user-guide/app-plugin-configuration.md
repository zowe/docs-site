## App plugin configuration

The App framework will load plugins from Components such as extensions based upon their enabled status in Zowe configuration. The server caches knowledge of these plugins in the `<workspaceDirectory>/app-server/plugins` folder. This location can be customized with the *components.app-server.pluginsDir* variable in the Zowe configuration file.
