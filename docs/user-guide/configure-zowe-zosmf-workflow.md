# Configuring Zowe with z/OSMF Workflows

After you install Zowe, you can register and execute the z/OSMF workflows in the web interface to perform a range of
Zowe configuration tasks. z/OSMF helps to simplify the Zowe configuration tasks and does not require the level of
expertise that is needed to perform manual Zowe configuration. This configuration method also runs the `zwe init`
command to initialize Zowe z/OS runtime.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you meet the following requirements before you start your Zowe configuration:

- Install and configure z/OSMF
- Install Zowe with an SMP/E build, PSWI, or a convenience build

## Overview of Full Zowe server-side configuration for Zowe 3.0 workflow

You can complete the following tasks with the **Full Zowe server-side configuration for Zowe 3.0** workflow:

- Configure the Zowe instance
- Enable the API Gateway
- Enable ZAAS
- Enable the API Catalog
- Enable the Discovery service
- Enable a Caching service
- Enable an Application server
- Enable the ZSS component
- Enable JES Explorer
- Enable MVS Explorer
- Enable USS Explorer

You can execute the **Full Zowe server-side configuration Zowe 3.0** workflow either from a PSWI during deployment or later from a created software
instance in z/OSMF. Alternatively, you can execute the configuration workflow in z/OSMF during the workflow registration
process.

The configuration workflow described in this article is executed directly from a deployment of the Zowe PSWI.

## Executing Full Zowe server-side configuration for Zowe 3.0 workflow from PSWI

After Zowe installation, follow this procedure to perform Zowe server-side configuration.

:::tip
For more information about installing Zowe server-side components with z/OSMF, see [Installing Product Software Using z/OSMF Deployments](./install-zowe-pswi-deployment.md).
:::

1. In the **Software Management** panel, click **Actions** and **Add from z/OSMF System**. 
2. Specify your system name and file location path (UNIX file).
3. Click **Retrieve**. 
4. Review the Deployment Jobs and click **Deployment Checklist**.
5. Follow each step outlined in the **Deployment Checklist**.

![Deployment Checklist](../images/zosmf/perform-workflows.png)

As presented in the **Deployment Checklist**, during deployment you have the option to perform workflows.

After you complete all of the preceding steps outlined in the **Deployment Checklist**, click **Perform workflows** to leverage configuration with z/OSMF workflows.

Each workflow appears in the panel.

:::note
The **Perform Workflows** step enables you to run either all attached workflows or just the
    post-deployment workflow for mounting, which is required.
:::

:::caution Important
Before you start your configuration, ensure that you first perform the **Zowe Mount** workflow. For more information, see [Configure - UNIX file system mount points](https://www.newera.com/INFO/061422_zOSMF_SM.pdf) in the IBM documentation. 
:::

After you successfully perform the **Zowe Mount** workflow, you can start the **Full Zowe server-side configuration for Zowe 3.0** workflow.

Select the **Full Zowe server-side configuration for Zowe 3.0** workflow from the list of Workflow Definition Files.  
The following screen displays: 

![Full Zowe server-side configuration for Zowe 3.0 workflow](../images/zosmf/workflow-zoweConfiguration.png)

Expand the **Workflow Details** panel to see the workflow details and the state of each step.
This workflow is in three parts:

[Define variables](#define-variables)  
[Create configuration](#create-configuration)  
[Perform Zowe installation](#perform-zowe-installation)

### Define variables

This workflow step includes the list of Zowe variables for configuration and as well as sub-steps.

1. Expand **Define variables** to display the following screen:  

![Step1: Define variables](../images/zosmf/workflow-defineVariables.png)

2. Under **Input Variables**, click **Define the main variables**.
3. Click the **Perform** tab. The input variables are displayed by category. 
4. Customize workflow variables in the fields provided.  
   **Example:**

    ![Enabling components](../images/zosmf/workflow-componentsVariables.png)

  5. Perform the applicable sub-steps that correspond to the components you choose to enable.

#### Sequence to execute steps and sub-steps in the workflow

   Perform the following steps for each step and sub-step:

  1. Click the title of the step or sub-step.
  2. Select the **Perform** tab.
  3. Review the step contents and update the variables that are marked by a red asterisk based on your mainframe environment.  
   :::note
    Once completed, sub-steps for configured components are in the **Ready** state. Components that are not enabled are shown in the **Skipped** state.
    :::

  4. Select **Next**.
  5. Repeat the previous steps in this sequent to complete all items until the **Finish** option is available.  
   :::note Notes
      * You can click **Save**, to save your values and **Finish** to populate these values in subsequent steps.
   
      * Basic validation is supported in many of the fields including the proper path structure, dataset name conventions, or numeric size.
   The workflow, however, does not check, for example, if a target dataset exists, or if a directory has sufficient space.
   :::
   6.  When you complete this list of Input variables, click **Next** to view the components. Tick each component in this list that you want to enable.
   7. Click **Finish** to populate the values. This action customizes your workflow according to the components.  
   You are then presented with enabled sub-steps according to the Zowe components you specified. 
   8. Click each sub-step and customize component-specific variables. Click **Next** until you complete your customization of the variables.
   9. Click **Finish** to apply the values.
  

After all sub-steps are completed, the step **Define variables** is marked as Complete.

### Create configuration

This step creates a configuration zowe.yaml file with the variable setup that was defined in the **Define variables** workflow.

1. Review your configurations.
2. If necessary, customize the JCL according you your specifications and click **Finish**.  
   The zowe.yaml file is ready, and the step is marked as Complete.

:::note
The **Create configuration** step is mandatory. A valid zowe.yaml is required to execute the **Zowe installation** step.
:::

### Perform Zowe installation

This step consumes the zowe.yaml configuration file and contains three sub-steps.

1. **Run Zowe install** runs the `zwe install` command.
2. **Run Zowe init** runs `zwe init mvs` and `zwe init stc` commands.
3. **Run Zowe init security**.  
   This sub-step is optional if you already preformed security setup for Zowe. This sub-step requires Security Administrator permissions, which are required to run the `zwe init apfauth` and `zwe init security` commands. If security is not set up for Zowe, contact your Security Administrator to perform this setup. 

   :::note
   An alternative to executing **Run Zowe init security** is to submit `ZWESECUR` JCL. For details, see [Configuring security](configuring-security.md).
   :::

For more information about `zwe install` and `zwe init` commands, see the following articles:

* [zwe install command](../appendix/zwe_server_command_reference/zwe/zwe-install.md)
* [Configuring Zowe with zwe init](initialize-zos-system.md)

### Schema information and next steps

The **Full Zowe server-side configuration for Zowe 3.0** workflow strictly follows Zowe v3 install and configuration schema. This workflow generates the zowe.yaml file and runs Zowe's zwe CLI tool.

After completing the workflow execution, you can return to the **Deployment Checklist** for the Zowe PSWI.
After you complete the steps in the checklist you are ready to start your Zowe instance.
