# Obtaining installation files

The Zowe installation files are distributed as a PAX file that contains the runtimes and the scripts to install and launch the z/OS runtime and the runtime for the command line interface. For each release, there is a PAX file named `zowe-v.r.m.pax`, where

- `v` indicates the version
- `r` indicates the release number
- `m` indicates the modification number

The numbers are incremented each time a release is created so the higher the numbers, the later the release.  Use your web browser to download the PAX file by saving it to a folder on your desktop.

You can download the PAX file from the [Zowe website](https://zowe.org/download/). After you obtain the PAX file, verify the PAX file and prepare it to install the Zowe runtime.

**Follow these steps:**

1. Verify the downloaded PAX file.

    After you download the PAX file, verify the integrity of the PAX file to ensure that the file you download is officially distributed by the Zowe project.

    **Notes:**

    - The commands in the following steps are tested on both Mac OS X V10.13.6 and Ubuntu V16.04 and V17.10.
    - Ensure that you have GPG installed. Click [here](https://www.gnupg.org/) to download and install GPG.
    - The `v.r.m` in the commands of this step is a variable. You must replace it with the actual PAX file version, for example, `0.9.0`.

    a. Verify the hash code.

      Download the hash code file `zowe-v.r.m.pax.sha512` from the [Zowe website](https://projectgiza.org/Downloads/verify.html). Then, run the following commands to check:

      ```
      (gpg --print-md SHA512 zowe-v.r.m.pax > zowe-v.r.m.pax.sha512.my) && diff zowe-v.r.m.pax.sha512.my zowe-v.r.m.pax.sha512 && echo matched || echo "not match"
      ```

      When you see "matched", it means the PAX file that you download is the same one that is officially distributed by the Zowe project. You can delete the temporary "zowe-v.r.m.pax.sha512.my" file.

      You can also use other commands such as `sha512`, `sha512sum`, or `openssl dgst -sha512` to generate `SHA512` hash code. These hash code results are in a different format from what Zowe provides but the values are the same.

    b. Verify with signature file.

      In addition to the SHA512 hash, the hash is also verifiable. This is done by digitally signing the hash text file with a KEY from one of the Zowe developers.

      **Follow these steps:**

      1. Download the signature file `zowe-v.r.m.pax.asc` from [Zowe website](https://projectgiza.org/Downloads/verify.html), and download the public key `KEYS` from https://github.com/zowe/release-management/.
      2. Import the public key with command `gpg --import KEYS`.
      3. If you have never used gpg before, generate keys with command `gpg --gen-key`.
      3. Sign the downloaded public key with command `gpg --sign-key DC8633F77D1253C3`.
      4. Verify the file with command `gpg --verify zowe-v.r.m.pax.asc zowe-v.r.m.pax`.
      5. Optional: You can remove the imported key with command: `gpg --delete-key DC8633F77D1253C3`.

     When you see output similar to the followin one, it means the PAX file that you download is the same one that is officially distributed by the Zowe project.

     ```
     gpg: Signature made Tue 14 Aug 2018 08:29:46 AM EDT
     gpg: using RSA key DC8633F77D1253C3
     gpg: Good signature from "Matt Hogstrom (CODE SIGNING KEY) " [full]
     ```

2. Transfer the PAX file to z/OS.

    a. Open a terminal in Mac OS/Linux, or command prompt in Windows OS, and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Zowe PAX file.

    b. Connect to z/OS using SFTP. Issue the following command:

     ```
     sftp <userID@ip.of.zos.box>
     ```

     If SFTP is not available or if you prefer to use FTP, you can issue the following command instead:

     ```
     ftp <userID@ip.of.zos.box>
     ```

     **Note:** When you use FTP, switch to binary file transfer mode by issuing the following command:

     ```
     bin
     ```

    c. Navigate to the target directory that you wish to transfer the Zowe PAX file into on z/OS.

    **Note:** After you connect to z/OS and enter your password, you enter into the Unix file system. The following commands are useful:

    - To see what directory you are in, type `pwd`.
    - To switch directory, type `cd`.
    - To list the contents of a directory, type `ls`.
    - To create a directory, type `mkdir`.   

    d. When you are in the directory you want to transfer the Zowe PAX file into, issue the following command:

     ```
     put <pax-file-name>.pax
     ```

    Where _pax-file-name_ is a variable that indicates the full name of the PAX file you downloaded.

    **Note:** When your terminal is connected to z/OS through FTP or SFTP, you can prepend commands with `l` to have them issued against your desktop.  To list the contents of a directory on your desktop, type `lls` where `ls` will list contents of a directory on z/OS.  

3. When the PAX file is transferred, expand the PAX file by issuing the following command in an ssh session:

    ```
    pax -ppx -rf <pax-file-name>.pax
    ```  

    Where _pax-file-name_ is a variable that indicates the name of the PAX file you downloaded.


    This will expand to a file structure.

    ```
      /files
      /install
      /scripts
      ...
    ```

     **Note**: The PAX file will expand into the current directory. A good practice is to keep the installation directory apart from the directory that contains the PAX file.  To do this, you can create a directory such as `/zowe/paxes` that contains the PAX files, and another such as `/zowe/builds`.  Use SFTP to transfer the Zowe PAX file into the `/zowe/paxes` directory, use the `cd` command to switch into `/zowe/builds` and issue the command `pax -ppx -rf ../paxes/<zowe-v.r.m>.pax`.  The `/install` folder will be created inside the `zowe/builds` directory from where the installation can be launched.
