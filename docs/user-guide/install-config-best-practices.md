# Review install and configuration best practices 

As a system or security administrator, review the following best practices to prepare for your installation and configuration of Zowe server-side components.

**Choose the Right Distribution**  
Zowe is distributed in different forms, such as Zowe Conformance or Zowe Community Edition. Choose the distribution that best fits your needs and the level of support you require.

**Review System Requirements**  
Ensure that your mainframe environment meets the system requirements specified in the documentation. This includes hardware, software, and network prerequisites. For more information, see [Address system requirements](./)

**Use Zowe Installation Scripts**  
Zowe provides installation scripts that automate many of the installation and configuration tasks. These scripts can help simplify the process and reduce the chances of errors.

**Plan Your Configuration**  
Before you start the installation, plan your Zowe configuration carefully. Decide which Zowe components and plugins you need, and configure them according to your organization's requirements.

**Security Considerations**  
Follow security best practices, such as enabling SSL/TLS for encrypted communication and configuring authentication and authorization mechanisms.

**Backup and Recovery**  
Implement a robust backup and recovery strategy for your Zowe configuration. This includes regular backups of configuration files and data, as well as documented procedures for restoring in case of failures.

**Create a Testing Environment**  
Set up a testing environment that mirrors your production environment as closely as possible. Test the installation and configuration in this environment to catch any issues before deploying in production.

**Monitoring and Logging**  
Implement monitoring and logging solutions to keep an eye on the health and performance of your Zowe installation. Tools like Prometheus and Grafana can be used for this purpose.

**Ensure that you are current**  
Keep your Zowe components, plugins, and dependencies up-to-date with the latest versions and patches. Regularly check for updates and apply them in a controlled manner.

**Leverage Community Support**  
The Zowe community is active and can be a valuable resource for troubleshooting and sharing best practices. Don't hesitate to reach out to the community for assistance.

**Performance Tuning**  
Depending on your workload, you may need to fine-tune Zowe for optimal performance. Monitor resource usage and consider adjusting configuration parameters accordingly.

**Scalability**  
Plan for scalability as your mainframe workload grows. Zowe should be able to handle increased demand, so design your architecture with scalability in mind.
