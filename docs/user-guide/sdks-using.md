# Using Zowe SDKs

Leverage the Zowe Client Software Development Kits (SDKs) to build client applications and scripts that interface with the mainframe.

The SDKs include programmatic APIs, each of which performs a particular mainframe task. For example, one API package provides the ability to upload and download z/OS data sets. You can leverage that package to rapidly build a client application that interacts with data sets.

The following SDKs are available.
- Zowe Node.js Client SDK
- Zowe Python Client SDK

## API documentation

For details about the available API endpoints, browse or download the [API Reference documentation](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/#zowe-client-sdk-reference-guides).

## Software requirements

### Node.js

If you install Node SDK packages from the online registry, the required dependencies are installed automatically.

If you download Node SDK packages from Zowe.org, the folder contains dependencies that you must install manually. Extract the TGZ files from the folder, copy the files to your project, and issue the following commands to install the dependencies.

```
npm install imperative.tgz
```

```
npm install core-for-zowe-sdk.tgz
```

### Python

If you install Python SDK packages from the online registry, the required dependencies are installed automatically.

If you download the Python SDK packages from Zowe.org, the downloaded folder contains dependencies that you must install manually. Extract the WHL files from the folder, copy the files to your project, and issue the following command for each dependency:

```
pip install <fileName>.whl
```

## Getting started

To get started, import the SDK packages to your project. You can pull the packages from an online registry, or download the packages from Zowe.org to install locally.

### Install SDK from online registry

Pull the packages from an online registry such as npm or PyPi.

**Follow these steps:**

1. In command-line window, navigate to your project directory. Issue the following command to install a package from the registry:

   - To import a Node.js package: `npm install <PackageName>`
   - To import a Python package: `pip install <PackageName>`

   *where* `<packageName>` is the name of the SDK package that you want to install, such as `zos-files-for-zowe-sdk`.

    The packages are installed. Node packages are defined in `package.json` in your project. Python packages are installed by default to `$PYTHONPATH/Lib/site-packages` (Linux) or to the Python folder in your local `/AppData` folder (Windows).

2. **(Optional)** You might want to automatically update the SDK version when updates become available, or you might want to prevent automatic updates.

    - To define the versioning scheme for Node packages, use [npm semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#x-ranges-12x-1x-12-).

    - To define versioning for Python packages, specify versions or version ranges in a `requirements.txt` file checked-in to your project. More information, see [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#example-requirements-file)

### Install SDK from local package

Download and install the packages.

**Follow these steps:**

1. Navigate to [Zowe.org Downloads](https://www.zowe.org/download.html). Select your desired programming language in the **Zowe Client SDKs** section.

   The SDK is downloaded to your computer.

2. Unzip the SDK folder, which contains the packages for each set of functionality (such as z/OS Jobs). Copy each file that you want to install and paste them into your project directory.

3. Install required dependencies, which are included in the bundle. See [Software requirements](#software-requirements) above for more information.

3. In a command-line window, navigate to your project directory. Issue *one* of the following commands.

   - To install a Node.js package: `npm install <packageName>.tgz`
   - To install a Python package: `pip install <packageName>.whl`

    *where* `<packageName>` is the name of the package that you want to install, such as `zos-files-for-zowe-sdk`.

    Repeat the command for each package that you need. Packages are now installed.

## Using

After you install the SDK, you can make API calls to the mainframe from within your project.

### Using - Node.js

For Node SDK usage and syntax examples, refer to the following package Readmes:
