# Defaults
The terminal bundle that is used by tn3270-ng2 has several keyboard shortcuts to execute common TN3270 emulator functionality. Below is the current list of what function is mapped to which key combination. 

Be aware that some browsers intercept key combinations that are common to browsers, such as Control+R or Control+T, and that the OS may also intercept certain combinations such as Windows+R or Alt+F4. 

Also be aware that the key combinations listed will only be handled by the terminal if the terminal has focus - which you can know by if the terminal's cursor is visible and blinking or not. To gain focus on the terminal, it is sufficient to click on the terminal's contents. The difference between focus and not focus may be the difference between F5 being interpreted as terminal PF5, or the browser reloading the page.
