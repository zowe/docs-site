# Configuring Slack chat platform

If you use Slack as your chat platform, you must create and install one Slack App.

-   **[Creating and installing Slack App](chatops_prerequisite_slack_app.md)**  
You must create one Slack App and install it before you can talk with your chat bot in Slack client.
-   **[Adding your bot user to your Slack channel](chatops_prerequisite_invite_app_to_channel.md)**  
You can add the bot user that you created to your Slack channel in two ways: either mention your bot user directly in the message field or click the link **Add an app** at the beginning of your channel.
