# Sharing IBM Service Management Unite links to channel

You can use the **Copy as Link** function in IBMÂ® Service Management Unite to create links from IBM Service Management Unite. When you paste the links to chat, the bot user bnz can provide the preview of the target resource, domain, or system.
