# Integrating with IBM Watson AIOps

This is only a usage scenario. You can integrate Zowe Chat with IBM Watson AIOps in the future release.

1.  An alert, for example, from OMEGAMON, SA or IZOA, is sent to WAIOps.

2.  WAIOps can correlate with other events across hybrid environment, and forward the incident to teamâ€™s channel of Slack or Microsoft Teams providing details and drill-down links.

3.  You can collaborate in the chat channel and use Zowe Chat to get more information about the incident from Z management software directly from the chat.

4.  Zowe Chat provides related Z objects and recommendations.

5.  You can use Z chatbot to issue commands to Z systems to resolve issues or use drill-down links to switch to SMU to work with Z resources.
