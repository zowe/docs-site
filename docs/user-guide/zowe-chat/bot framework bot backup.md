-   Create a bot with **Bot Management** and set it up.

    1.  Select **Bot Management** option on the App Studio homepage.

        ![Bot management](bnz_bot_mgmt.png "Bot management")

    2.  Specify the name of your bot and click **Create**.

        ![Create a bot](bnz_create_bot_mgmt.png "Create a bot")

        It takes a while to register the bot in the Bot Framework. You can see the success status when it is completed.

        ![Bot created](bnz_quick_create_bot.png "Bot created")

        Save the Bot Id and password for later use. The password appears only once here.

    3.  Switch to **Existing bot** if you have an existing bot. Select **Select from one of my existing bots** and select the bot that you created. If your bot does not appear automatically, use the Bot ID to connect to it.

        Select **Team** for **Scope** so that you can add the bot app to your teams. Save your settings and you can see your bot in the **Bots** panel.
