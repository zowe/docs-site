# Configuring Slack

If you use Slack as your chat platform, you must create and install one Slack App.

1. [Creating and installing Slack App](chat_prerequisite_slack_create_app.md)

   You must create one Slack App and install it before you can talk with your chat bot in Slack client.
   
2. [Adding your bot user to your Slack channel](chat_prerequisite_slack_invite_app_to_channel.md)  

   You can add the bot user that you created to your Slack channel in two ways: either mention your bot user directly in the message field or click the link **Add an app** at the beginning of your channel.
