# Zowe CLI Installation checklist

The following checklists summarize the required steps for a base installation (_first-time installation_) in the order you should perform them.

The checklist includes a brief description of the steps, with links to the comprehensive information required for the installation. The checklist also identifies the roles that are typically required to complete the step, which enables the pre-installation planning team (systems administrator, DevOps architect, application developer, and so on) to focus on the tasks for which they are responsible. 

Use the Status column to track your progress.

| [Determine the profile types that you want to use](../user-guide/cli-using-using-team-profiles) | Learn about configuration and how to use team profiles | Systems administrator, DevOps architect | **.25** hrs |  |

**Note-1:** Allow **.25** hours to install the client-side software. The amount of time to install the host-side software depends upon your site's implementation. For example, do you require z/OSMF, REST APIs, or both, to support the Mediation Layer? See the information for the specific server-side software that you require to determine how much time to allow for complete server-side installation and configuration.

**Note-2:** Allow **15** to **25** hours to install and configure z/OSMF. The length of time varies depending on the External Security Manager (ESM) that you are running in your site.

You are now ready to install Zowe CLI!
