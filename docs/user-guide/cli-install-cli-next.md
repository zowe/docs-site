## Install Zowe CLI from npm

Use the following procedure to install Zowe CLI from an npm registry:

1. To install or update the core CLI, open a command-line window:

   ```
   npm install -g @zowe/cli@next
   ```

   Zowe CLI is installed.

2. (Optional) Check [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) for any Zowe plug-ins that have an `@next` version available. If an `@next` version is available, you can install it:

    ```
    zowe plugins install @zowe/<plugin-name>@next
    ```

    If no `@next` version is available,  install the `@latest` version of the plug-in:

    ```
    zowe plugins install @zowe/<plugin-name>
    ```

    Optional plug-ins are installed.

3. Migrate your Zowe CLI profiles from your current installation to your @next installation. Issue the following command:
   ```
   zowe config convert-profiles
   ```
   **Note:** Profile data is backed up in case you want to revert the profiles to your previous Zowe CLI installation.

4. (Optional) If you no longer require the profiles for your previous Zowe CLI installation, you can delete them.
 
   **Important:** We do not recommend deleting the profiles for your previous Zowe CLI installation until you have tested your @next installation and are satisfied with its performance.
   
   Issue the following command:
   ```
   zowe config convert-profiles --delete
   ```
