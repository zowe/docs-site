# Trusting certificates in client environments



## Importing an existing PKCS12 certificate

To import a PKCS12 certificate, it is first necessary to import a certificate authority (CA). There are two options for importing a CA:

* [Manually importing a certificate authority into a web browser](#manually-importing-a-certificate-authority-into-a-web-browser)
* [Importing a local CA certificate on Linux](#importing-a-local-ca-certificate-on-linux)

## Importing a certificate Authority (CA)

Importing a certificate authority (CA) is a prerequisite to importing a PKCS12 certificate. Use the method that applies to your use case.

* [Importing a local CA certificate on Linux](#importing-a-local-ca-certificate-on-linux)

### Manually importing a certificate authority into a web browser

To avoid the browser untrusted CA challenge, import Zowe certificates into the browser.

Trust in the API ML server is a necessary precondition for secure communication between the browser or API Client application. Ensure this trust by installing a Certificate Authority (CA) public certificate. By default, API ML creates a local CA. Import the CA public certificate to the truststore for REST API clients and to your browser. You can also import the certificate to your root certificate store.

:::tip  
 If a SAF keyring is used and set up with `ZWEKRING` JCL, the procedure to obtain the certificate does not apply. In this case, we recommended that you work with your security system administrator to obtain the certificate.  
:::

The public certificate in [PEM format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail) is stored in a USS directory a defined in the `zowe.yaml` configuration file in the section `zowe.certificate.pem.certificateAuthorities`. The certificate is stored in UTF-8 encoding so you need to transfer the certificate as a binary file. Since this is the certificate to be trusted by your browser, it is recommended to use a secure connection for transfer.

:::note  
Windows currently does not recognize the PEM format. For Windows, use the P12 version of the `local_cer`.

#### Importing commands according to your operating system

To import the certificate to your root certificate store and trust it, follow the applicable procedure based on your operating system.

For Windows, click here for command details.

```
certutil -enterprise -f -v -AddStore Root" localca.cer
```

**Note:** Ensure that you open the terminal as **administrator**. This operation installs the certificate to the Trusted Root Certification Authorities.

$ sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain localca.cer
```

Manually import your root certificate via the Firefox settings, or force Firefox to use the Windows truststore.
As a default, Firefox uses its own certificate truststore.

Create a new Javascript file firefox-windows-truststore.js at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\defaults\pref` with the   following content:

```
/* Enable experimental Windows truststore support */
pref("security.enterprise_roots.enabled", true);
```

:::tip
To avoid requiring each browser to trust the CA that signed the Zowe certificate, you can use a public certificate authority to create a certificate. Optional public certificate authorities include _Symantec_, _Comodo_, _Let's Encrypt_, or _GoDaddy_.  Certificates generated by such public CAs are trusted by all browsers and most REST API clients. This option, however, requires a manual process to request a certificate and may incur a cost payable to the publicly trusted CA.

After successfully manually importing a certificate authority into a web browser, you can now [import an existing PKCS12 certificate](#importing-an-existing-pkcs12-certificate).

### Importing a local CA certificate on Linux

Zowe also supports importing certificates to make REST HTTPS curl request from the command line.

Follow these steps to import `local_ca.cer` from the path `.../zowe/keystore/local_ca`.

:::note
Steps are verified with Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS.
:::

1. Rename `local_ca.cer` with `local_ca.crt` and copy to the shared ca-certificates path.
   
   `$ cp local_ca.cer /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/zowe_local_ca.crt`

2. Execute a ca-certificate store update by running the following command:
   
   `$ sudo update-ca-certificates`

3. Verify that the new expected certificate was added (the newest will be at the bottom of the list which contains an extended list of concatenated CAs).
   
   `$ cat /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`

4. Run a basic curl HTTPS request from the command line. For example, run the following command:

  ```
  curl --request 'GET'
  --url 'https://tvt6092.svl.ibm.com:7554/jobs/api/v1?owner=ibmuser&prefix=*'
  --header 'Authorization: Basic ************'
  ```

After successfully importing your local CA certificate on Linux, you can now [import an existing PKCS12 certificate](#importing-an-existing-pkcs12-certificate).

## Next steps

Once your certificate is successfully imported, review the documentation about how to [use certificates](./use-certificates.md) in a Zowe production environment.
