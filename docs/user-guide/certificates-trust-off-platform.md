# Trusting certificates off platform

Zowe services are protected by the certificates you set in your `zowe.yaml` configuration file, and these certificates are presented to all clients connecting to Zowe, including off-platform clients. If you are using your browser to view Zowe's API Mediation Layer or Web Desktop, or if you are using Zowe Explorer with an API Mediation Layer connection profile, the certificate Zowe presents might be challenged by your browser or operating system. This article covers a common method for trusting certificates: importing them in your off-platform client environment.

## Importing a certificate authority (CA)

Importing a certificate authority (CA) is a prerequisite to importing a PKCS12 certificate. Use the method that applies to your use case.

* [Importing commands according to your operating system](#importing-commands-according-to-your-operating-system)

### Manually importing a certificate authority into a web browser

To avoid the browser untrusted CA challenge, import Zowe certificates into the browser.

Trust in the API ML server is a necessary precondition for secure communication between the browser or API Client application. Ensure this trust by installing a Certificate Authority public certificate. By default, API ML creates a local CA. Import the CA public certificate to the truststore for REST API clients and to your browser. You can also import the certificate to your root certificate store.

:::tip  
 If a SAF key ring is used and the certificate was generated on z/OS, the procedure to obtain the certificate does not apply. In this case, it is recommended that you work with your security system administrator to obtain the certificate.  
:::

The public certificate in [PEM format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail) is stored in a USS directory and defined in the `zowe.yaml` configuration file in the section `zowe.certificate.pem.certificateAuthorities`. The certificate is stored in UTF-8 encoding so you need to transfer the certificate as a binary file. Since this is the certificate to be trusted by your browser, it is recommended to use a secure connection for transfer.

:::note  
Windows currently does not recognize the PEM format. For Windows, use the P12 version of the `local_cer`.

#### Importing commands according to your operating system

To import the certificate to your root certificate store and trust it, follow the applicable procedure based on your operating system.

```
certutil -enterprise -f -v -AddStore Root localca.cer
```

:::note
Ensure that you open the terminal as **administrator**. This operation installs the certificate to the Trusted Root Certification Authorities.

```

Manually import your root certificate via the Firefox settings, or force Firefox to use the Windows truststore.
As a default, Firefox uses its own certificate truststore.

Create a new Javascript file firefox-windows-truststore.js at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\defaults\pref` with the following content:

```
/* Enable experimental Windows truststore support */
pref("security.enterprise_roots.enabled", true);
```

:::tip
To avoid requiring each browser to trust the CA that signed the Zowe certificate, you can use a public certificate authority to create a certificate. Optional public certificate authorities include _Symantec_, _Comodo_, _Let's Encrypt_, or _GoDaddy_.  Certificates generated by such public CAs are trusted by all browsers and most REST API clients. This option, however, requires a manual process to request a certificate and might incur a cost payable to the publicly trusted CA.

### Importing a local CA certificate on Linux

Zowe also supports importing certificates to make REST HTTPS curl request from the command line.

Follow these steps to import `local_ca.cer` from the path `.../zowe/keystore/local_ca`.

:::note
Steps are verified with Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS.
:::

1. Rename `local_ca.cer` with `local_ca.crt` and copy to the shared ca-certificates path.
   
   `$ cp local_ca.cer /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/zowe_local_ca.crt`

2. Execute a ca-certificate store update by running the following command:
   
   `$ sudo update-ca-certificates`

3. Verify that the new expected certificate was added (the newest certificate is at the bottom of the list which contains an extended list of concatenated CAs).
   
   `$ cat /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`

4. Run a basic curl HTTPS request from the command line. For example, run the following command:

  ```
  curl --request 'GET'
  --url 'https://tvt6092.svl.ibm.com:7554/jobs/api/v1?owner=ibmuser&prefix=*'
  --header 'Authorization: Basic ************'
  ```
## Next steps

Once your certificate is successfully imported, your browser and operating system should no longer challenge every connection as untrusted.
