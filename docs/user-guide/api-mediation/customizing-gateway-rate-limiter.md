# Customizing Gateway rate limiter

:::info Role: system programmer
:::

The API Gateway offers a way to customize the rate limit for each service via a configurable rate limiter, which prevents individual users from overloading the system with excessive requests.  Configuring the rate limiter helps ensure that a user's activity does not negatively impact the experience of other users by mitigating the risk of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks and other automated exploit attempts. 

Use the following procedure to customize the Gateway rate limiter:

1. In the zowe.yaml, set the following rate limiting properties in api/gateway:

   * **rateLimiterCapacity**  
  Defines the total number of requests that can be allowed at one time per user. The default value is set to 20.

   * **rateLimiterTokens**  
  Defines the number of requests that are added to the serviceâ€™s allowance at regular intervals. This property controls how quickly requests are replenished after being consumed. The default value is set to 20.

   * **rateLimiterRefillDuration**  
  Sets the time interval (in minutes) at which new requests (or tokens) are added. The default value is set to 1.

2. Define the services to limit:

   Use `servicesToLimitRequestRate` to specify a list of services to limit. In the following example, this property applies to the API Catalog. 

**Example configuration:**
```
    apiml:
        gateway: 
            rateLimiterCapacity: 35
            rateLimiterTokens: 35
            rateLimiterRefillDuration: 2
            servicesToLimitRequestRate: apicatalog
```
You configured the properties of the rate limiter for the API Catalog, thereby improving user accessibility and overall system stability.
