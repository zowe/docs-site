# Configuring security 

During the initial installation of Zowe server-side components, it is necessary for your organization's security administrator to perform a range of tasks that require elevated security permissions. As a security administrator, follow the procedures outlined in this article to configure Zowe and your z/OS system to run Zowe with z/OS.

:::info**Required roles:** system programmer, security administrator
:::

## Validate and re-run `zwe init` commands

During installation, the system programmer customizes values in the zowe.yaml file. However, due to insufficient permissions of the system programmer, the `zwe init security` command may fail. Consult with your security administrator to review your `ZWESECUR` job content so that your security adminstrator can re-submit this command.

## Initialize Zowe security configurations

Choose from the following methods to initialize Zowe security configurations:

* Configuring with `zwe init security`
* Configuring with `ZWESECUR` JCL

For more information about both of these methods, see [Initialize Zowe security configurations](./initialize-security-configuration).

## Perform APF authorization of load libraries

Zowe contains load modules that require access to make privileged z/OS security manager calls. These load modules are held in two load libraries which must be APF authorized. For more information about how to issue the `zwe init apfauth` command to perform APF authority commands, see [Performing APF authorization of load libraries](./apf-authorize-load-library).

## Configure the z/OS system for Zowe

Review and perform z/OS configuration steps based on your settings. For a detailed table of configuration procedures and associated purposes for performing these procedures, see [Configuring the z/OS system for Zowe](./configure-zos-system).

## Assign security permissions to users

Assign users (ZWESVUSR and ZWESIUSR) and the ZWEADMIN security group permissions required to perform specific tasks. For more information see, [Assign security permissions to users](./assign-security-permissions-to-users).

## Zowe Feature specific configuration tasks

Depending on the specific Zowe server-side components that your organization is wishing to utilize, specific security configuration settings may apply. Review the following table of Zowe server-side component features and their associated configuration tasks, and perform the tasks that apply to your use case.
