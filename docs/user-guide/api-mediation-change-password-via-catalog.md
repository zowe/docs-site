# Change password via API Catalog

In case expiration of a mainframe password, the API Catalog offers the possibility to set a new password, using either the SAF or the z/OSMF provider.
For more information about the password change functionality, see [Advanced Gateway features configuration](../user-guide/api-mediation/api-gateway-configuration.md).
