# Configuring Zowe CLI environment variables

This section explains how to configure Zowe CLI using environment variables.

By default, Zowe CLI configuration is stored on your computer in the `C:\Users\user01\.zowe` directory. The directory includes log files, profile information, and installed CLI plug-ins. When troubleshooting, refer to the logs in the `imperative` and `zowe` folders.

## Setting the CLI home directory

You can set the location on your computer where Zowe CLI creates the *.zowe* directory, which contains log files, profiles, and plug-ins for the product:

| Environment Variable | Description | Values | Default |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ------- |
| `ZOWE_CLI_HOME`  | Zowe CLI home directory location | Any valid path on your computer | Your computer default home directory |

## Setting CLI log levels

You can set the log level to adjust the level of detail that is written to log files:

**Important\!** Setting the log level to TRACE or ALL might result in "sensitive" data being logged. For example, command line arguments will be logged when TRACE is set.

| Environment Variable | Description | Values | Default |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |------- | ------- |
| `ZOWE_APP_LOG_LEVEL`        | Zowe CLI logging level            | Log4JS log levels (OFF, TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL) | WARN |
| `ZOWE_IMPERATIVE_LOG_LEVEL` | Imperative CLI Framework logging level | Log4JS log levels (OFF, TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL) | WARN |



## Setting CLI daemon mode properties

By default, the CLI daemon mode binary creates or reuses a file in the user's home directory each time a Zowe CLI command runs. In some cases, this behavior might be undesirable. For example, the home directory resides on a network drive and has poor file performance. To change the location that the daemon uses, set the environment variables that are described in the following table:


| Platform | Environment Variable  | Description | Values | Default |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Windows | `ZOWE_DAEMON_LOCK` | Specifies an alternative path to the lock file that restricts access to the named pipe that the daemon uses for communication. | Any valid path on your computer | `%HOMEPATH%\.zowe-daemon.lock` |
| Linux, macOS | `ZOWE_DAEMON` | Specifies an alternative path to the socket that the daemon uses for communication. | Any valid path on your computer | `$HOME/.zowe-daemon.sock` |
| Windows | `ZOWE_DAEMON` | Specifies an alternative name for the named pipe that the daemon uses for communication. The environment variable cannot be defined as a file path that resides on a disk. | Any valid Windows pipe name without the `\\.\` prefix | `%USERNAME%\ZoweDaemon` |
