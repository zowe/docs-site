# Usage tips

The following tips can help you perform tasks more efficiently when working with the CICS extension:

- All menu action commands available via right-clicking a profile or resource (excluding **Show Attributes**) can be applied to multiple items. To do this, you can multi-select the nodes of the same type before right-clicking and selecting the command.

- To multi-select, you can hold Ctrl/Cmd key while clicking resources. Or you can select the first item in a list of nodes then hold Shift and click both the last item to select a consecutive list of nodes.

- Click the refresh icon at the top of the CICS view to reload the resources in every region.
