# Using Zowe CLI

Learn about how to use Zowe CLI, including connecting to the mainframe, managing profiles, integrating with API Mediation Layer, and more.

You can use the CLI interactively from a command window on any computer on which it is installed, or run it in a container or automation environment.

**Tip:** If you want to use the CLI together with a screen reader to provide accessibility, we recommend using the Mac™ Terminal application enabled for Accessibility through [System Preferences > Accessibility](https://support.apple.com/zh-sg/guide/terminal/trml1020/mac). On Windows™, adjust the Properties settings in Command Prompt. For other operating systems, or for alternative terminals, check the specification for the terminal to ensure that it meets accessibility requirements.
