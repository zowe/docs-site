# IBM® CICS® Plug-in for Zowe CLI 

The IBM® CICS® Plug-in for Zowe&trade; CLI lets you extend Zowe CLI to interact with CICS programs and transactions. The plug-in uses the IBM CICS® Management Client Interface (CMCI) API to achieve the interaction with CICS.

## Creating a user profile

You can set up a CICS profile to avoid typing your connection details on every command. The profile contains your host, port, username, and password for the CMCI instance of your choice. You can create multiple profiles and switch between them if necessary. Issue the following command to create a cics profile: 

```
zowe profiles create cics <profile name> -H <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p <password>
```

**Note:** For more information, issue the command `zowe profiles create cis --help`
