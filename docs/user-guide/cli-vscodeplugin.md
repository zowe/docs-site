# Zowe Explorer Extension for VSCode

The Zowe Explorer extension for Visual Studio Code (VSCode) lets you interact with data sets, USS files and jobs that are stored on z/OS mainframe. Install the extension directly to [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to enable the extension within the GUI. For some users, working with data sets and USS files from VSC can be more convenient than using 3270 emulators, and complements your Zowe CLI experience.

**Note:** The primary documentation for the Zowe Explorer is available on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zowe.vscode-extension-for-zowe). This article is a high-level overview of the extension.
