# Installing Node.js on z/OS

Before you install Zowe&trade;, you must install IBM SDK for Node.js on the same z/OS server that hosts the Zowe Application Server. Review the information in this topic to obtain and install Node.js.

## Supported Node.js versions

The following Node.js versions are supported to run Zowe. See the [Hardware and software prerequisites](#hardware-and-software-prerequisites) section for the prerequisites that are required by Zowe.

The corresponding [IBM Knowledge Center for Node.js - z/OS](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWLKB/welcome_nodesdk_family.html) lists all the prerequisites for Node.js. Some software packages, which might be listed as prerequisites there, are **NOT** required by Zowe. Specifically, you do **NOT** need to install Python, Make, Perl, or C/C++ runtime or compiler.  If you can run `node --version` successfully, you have installed the prerequisites required by Zowe.

- v6.x starting with v6.14.4
    - z/OS V2R2 with PTF UI46658 or z/OS V2R3

- v8.x (except v8.16.1)
   - z/OS V2R2: PTFs UI62788, UI46658, UI62416 (APARs PH10606, PI79959, PH10740)
   - z/OS V2R3: PTFs UI61308, UI61376, and UI61747 (APARs PH07107, PH08353, and PH09543)

   **Known issue:** There is a known issue with node.js v8.16.1 and Zowe desktop encoding. See the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ibmruntimes/node/issues/142) for details.

   **Workaround:** Use node.js v8.16.2 or later, which is available at [https://www.ibm.com/ca-en/marketplace/sdk-nodejs-compiler-zos](https://www.ibm.com/ca-en/marketplace/sdk-nodejs-compiler-zos). Download the `pax.Z` file.

- v12.x

## How to obtain IBM SDK for Node.js - z/OS

You can obtain IBM SDK for Node.js - z/OS for free in one of the following ways:
- Order the SMP/E edition through your IBM representative for production use
- Use the PAX evaluation edition for non-production deployments

For more information, see the blog ["How to obtain IBM SDK for Node.js - z/OS, at no charge"](https://developer.ibm.com/mainframe/2019/04/17/ibm-sdk-for-node-js-z-os-at-no-charge/).

## Hardware and software prerequisites

To install Node.js for Zowe, the following requirements must be met.

The corresponding [IBM Knowledge Center for Node.js - z/OS](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWLKB/welcome_nodesdk_family.html) lists all the prerequisites for Node.js. Some software packages, which might be listed as prerequisites there, are **NOT** required by Zowe. Specifically, you do **NOT** need to install Python, Make, Perl, or C/C++ runtime or compiler.

If you can run `node --version` successfully, you have installed the Node.js prerequisites required by Zowe.

**Hardware:**

IBM zEnterpriseÂ® 196 (z196) or newer

**Software:**

- z/OS UNIX System Services enabled
- Integrated Cryptographic Service Facility (ICSF) configured and started

  ICSF is required for Node.js to operate successfully on z/OS.  If you have not configured your z/OS environment for ICSF, see [z/OS Cryptographic Services ICSF Administrators Guide](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLTBW_2.1.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r1.csfb300/toc.htm).  To see whether ICSF has been started, check whether the started task `ICSF` or `CSF` is active.

## Installing the PAX edition of Node.js - z/OS

Follow these steps to install the PAX edition of Node.js - z/OS to run Zowe.

1. Download the pax.Z file to a z/OS machine.
1. Extract the pax.Z file inside an installation directory of your choice. For example:

    ```pax -rf <path_to_pax.Z_file> -x pax```

1. Add the full path of your installation directory to your PATH environment variable:
    ```
    export PATH=<installation_directory>/bin/:$PATH
    ```
1. Run the following command from the command line to verify the installation.
    ```
    node --version
    ```

    If Node.js is installed correctly, the version of Node.js is displayed.
1. After you install Node.js, set the *NODE_HOME* environment variable to the directory where Node.js is installed. For example, `NODE_HOME=/proj/mvd/node/installs/node-v6.14.4-os390-s390x`.

## Installing the SMP/E edition of Node.js - z/OS

To install the SMP/E edition of Node.js, see the [documentation for IBM SDK for Node.js - z/OS](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWLKB/welcome_nodesdk_family.html). Remember that the software packages Perl, Python, Make, or C/C++ runtime or compiler that the Node.js documentation might mention are **NOT** needed by Zowe.
