# Addressing z/OS requirements

Before installing Zowe&trade; z/OS components, ensure that your z/OS environment meets the prerequisites. The prerequisites you need to install depend on what Zowe z/OS components you want to use and how you want to install and configure Zowe on z/OS. Assess your installation scenario and install the prerequisites that meet your needs. 

:::info Required roles: system programmer, security administrator
:::

All Zowe server components can be installed on a z/OS environment, while some can alternatively be installed on Linux or zLinux via Docker. The components provide a number of services that are accessed through a web browser such as an API catalog and a web desktop.  

## z/OS system requirements

Be sure your z/OS system meets the following prerequisites:

### z/OS

- z/OS version is in active support, such as Version 2.4, 2.5, and 3.1

  :::note Notes:
  * Zowe Version 2.11 or higher is required when using z/OS Version 3.1.
  * z/OS V2.3 reached end of support on 30 September, 2022. For more information, see the [z/OS v2.3 lifecycle details](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/zos23x-withdrawal-notification).
  :::

- zFS volume has at least 1200 mb of free space for Zowe server components, the corresponding keystore, instance configuration files and logs, and third-party plug-ins.

- System Display and Search Facility (SDSF)

  During the installation of Zowe, SDSF is used to interface with JES and send MVS commands such as `zwe init certificate`, `zwe start`, and `zwe stop`. Ensure that you have SDSF installed on z/OS. 
  
  Not having SDSF installed may result in the following error message:

  `IRX0043I Error running /Zowe/bin/utils/opercmd.rex, line 130: Routine not found`

 :::note
 The `zwe init certificate` step is only required if users anticipate the installation process to generate a keyring for them. If this setup has been completed beforehand, or if Zowe utilizes an existing keyring, `zwe init certificate` is unnecessary.
Alternative utilities such as Sysview can be used to perform similar functions to SDSF such as `zwe start` and `zwe stop` commands. These commands primarily manage the submission of the Zowe Started Task and its parameters, such as submitting  `haInstance=`, if applicable.
 :::
 
For more information about SDSF, see the _Abstract for z/OS SDSF Operation and Customization_ in the IBM documentation.

- (Optional, recommended) z/OS OpenSSH
  
  Some features of Zowe require SSH, such as the SSH terminal of the Desktop. Install and manage Zowe via SSH, as an alternative to OMVS over TN3270. 

- (Optional) Parallel Sysplex.
  
  To deploy Zowe for high availability, a Parallel Sysplex environment is recommended. For more information, see [Configuring Sysplex for high availability](configure-sysplex.md).

### Node.js

- Node.js v16.x or v18.x

  Node is not included with z/OS so must be installed separately.  To install Node.js on z/OS, follow the instructions in [Addressing Node.js requirements](install-nodejs-zos.md).
  
  :::tip
  If you are a software vendor building extensions for Zowe, we recommend you tag your plug-ins. For more information, see [Tagging on z/OS](../extend/extend-desktop/mvd-buildingplugins.md#tagging-plugin-files-on-z-os).
  :::

### Java 

- IBM SDK for Java Technology Edition V8

### z/OSMF (Optional) 

- (Optional, recommended) IBM z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF) Version 2.4, Version 2.5, or Version 3.1.

  z/OSMF is included with z/OS so does not need to be separately installed. If z/OSMF is present, Zowe  detects z/OSMF during configuration and uses z/OSMF for the following purposes:

  - Authenticating TSO users and generating a single sign-on JSON Web Token (JWT). Ensure that the [z/OSMF JWT Support is available via APAR and associated PTFs](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/apar/PH12143). If z/OSMF is not available, Zowe is still able to provide SSO by generating its own JWT and making direct SAF calls.  

  - REST API services for Files (Data Sets and USS), JES, and z/OSMF workflows.  These are used by some Zowe applications such as the Zowe Explorers in the Zowe Desktop. If z/OSMF REST APIs are not present, other Zowe desktop application, such as the File Editor that provides access to USS directories and files as well as MVS data sets and members, will work through the Zowe Z Secure Services (ZSS) component to access z/OS resources.   

  :::info Recommendations
  - For production use of Zowe, we recommend configuring z/OSMF to leverage Zowe functionalities that require z/OSMF. For more information, see [Configuring z/OSMF](systemrequirements-zosmf.md).
  - For non-production use of Zowe (such as development, proof-of-concept, demo), you can customize the configuration of z/OSMF to create **_z/OS MF Lite_** to simplify your setup of z/OSMF. z/OS MF Lite only supports selected REST services (JES, DataSet/File, TSO and Workflow), resulting in considerable improvements in startup time as well as a reduction in steps to set up z/OSMF. For information about how to set up z/OSMF Lite, see [Configuring z/OSMF Lite (non-production environment)](systemrequirements-zosmf-lite.md).
