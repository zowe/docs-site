# Using Zowe CLI

The Zowe command line interface (CLI) can be used interactively from a command window on any computer on which it is installed.

**Tip:** If you want to use the CLI together with a screen reader to provide accessibility, we recommend using the Mac™ Terminal application enabled for Accessibility through [System Preferences > Accessibility](https://support.apple.com/zh-sg/guide/terminal/trml1020/mac). On Windows™, adjust the Properties settings in Command Prompt. For other operating systems, or for alternative terminals, check the specification for the terminal to ensure that it meets accessibility requirements.

## Displaying Zowe CLI help

Zowe&trade; CLI has a command-line help system that helps you to learn about the commands, actions, and options available in the product.

- [Top-level help](#top-level-help)
- [Group, action, and object help](#group-action-and-object-help)
- [Interactive web help](#interactive-web-help)
- [Zowe CLI command reference](#zowe-cli-command-reference)

### Top-level help

To view top-level help, open a command-line and issue the following command:

```
zowe --help
```

![Issuing the help command](../images/guides/CLI/GetHelp.gif)

Alternatively, issue the following command to display a full list of all available commands:

```
zowe --ac
```

**Tip:** All Zowe CLI commands begin with `zowe.`

### Group, action, and object help

You can append `--help` to learn about a specific command group, action, or object.

For example, issue the following command to learn more about the `create` action in the `zos-files` group:

```
zowe zos-files create --help
```

### Interactive web help

You can launch an interactive form of help in your Web browser. Web help is custom-generated to include commands for all currently installed plug-ins. Issue the following command:

```
zowe --help-web
```

**Tip:** Append `--help-web` to a specific command or action to launch directly into the appropriate Web help page.

### Zowe CLI command reference

Command reference is available for download in three formats: a static copy of the interactive Web help, a ZIP file that contains the HTML web help, and a static PDF:

## Using the prompt for sensitive options

Zowe CLI lets you enable a command-line "prompt" feature, which masks values on the screen as you type. You might choose to enable the prompt for sensitive credentials such as mainframe username or password.

You can enable the prompt on-demand, or choose to always prompt for a particular option.

### Enable prompt

Enable on-demand prompting for arguments and options.

**Follow these steps:**

1. Begin typing a Zowe CLI command.

2. For the option(s) that you want to mask, insert the value `"PROMPT*"`. For example, prompt for your password:

    ```
    zowe zos-files list data-set "MY.DATASET.*" --host my.company.com --port 123 --user myusername123 --password "PROMPT*"
    ```

   The CLI prompts you to enter a value for the `--password` field.

3. Enter a value to complete the command.

    **Tip:** Enter the value carefully. The backspace key does not work in prompt mode.

### Always prompt

You can configure your environment so that the CLI *always* prompts for a particular option, such as `--password`.

To enable the feature, set an environment variable named `ZOWE_OPT_PASSWORD` with the value
`"PROMPT*"`. With the environment variable set, the CLI automatically enables the prompt when you omit a required `--password` value.

**Tip** The procedure for setting environment variables is dependent on your operating systems. Refer to documentation for your OS to learn about setting environment variables.

### Change the keyword for prompt

The default keyword that enables prompting in Zowe CLI is `"PROMPT*"`. You might want to change the keyword if there is a chance that `"PROMPT*"` could exist as a valid value for the field. For example, if you mask the `data-set` argument and are working with real mainframe data sets that begin with the characters `"PROMPT*"`.

To configure the keyword, choose a new value. Then define the value to to the environment variable on your computer named `ZOWE_PROMPT_PHRASE`.

## Zowe CLI command groups
Zowe CLI contains command groups that focus on specific business processes. For example, the `zos-files` command group
provides the ability to interact with mainframe data sets. This article provides you with a brief synopsis of the tasks that you can perform with each group. For more information, see [Display Zowe CLI Help](#displaying-zowe-cli-help).

The commands available in the product are organized in a hierarchical structure. Command groups (for example, `zos-files`) contain actions (for example, `create`) that let you perform actions on specific objects (for example, a specific type of data set). For each action that you perform on an object, you can specify options that affect the operation of the command.

**Important!** Before you issue these commands, verify that you
completed the steps in [Create a Zowe CLI profile](cli-configuringcli.md#creating-zowe-cli-profiles) and [Test Connection to z/OSMF](cli-configuringcli.md#testing-zowe-cli-connection-to-z-osmf) to help ensure that Zowe CLI can communicate with z/OS systems.

## Writing scripts to automate mainframe actions

You can combine multiple Zowe CLI commands in bash or shell scripts to automate actions on z/OS. You can implement scripts to enhance your development workflow, automate repetitive test or build tasks, and orchestrate mainframe actions from continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) tools such as Jenkins or TravisCI.

- [Writing a Script](#writing-a-script)
- [Example: Clean up Temporary Data Sets](#exampleOne)
- [Example: Submit Jobs and Save Spool Output](#exampleTwo)

### Writing a Script

Write a script that executes multiple CLI commands.

**Note:** The type of script that you write depends on the programming languages that you use and the environment where the script is executed. The following procedure is a general guide to Zowe CLI scripts, but you might need to refer to third-party documentation to learn more about scripting in general.

**Follow these steps:**

1. Create a new file on your computer with the extension .sh. For example, `testScript.sh`.

    **Note:** On Linux, an extension is not required. You make the file executable by issuing the command `chmod u+x testScript`.

2. At the top of the file, specify the interpreter that your script requires. For example, type `#!/bin/sh` or `#!/bin/sh`.

    **Note:** The command terminal that you use to execute the script depends on what you specify at the top of your script. Bash scripts require a bash interpreter (bash terminal), while shell scripts can be run from any terminal.

3. Write a script using a series of Zowe CLI commands.

    **Tip:** You can incorporate commands from other command-line tools in the same script. You might choose to "pipe" the output of one command into another command.

4. From the appropriate command terminal, issue a command to execute the script. The command you use to execute script varies by operating system.

The script runs and prints the output in your terminal. You can run scripts manually, or include them in your automated testing and delivery pipelines.

### <span id="exampleOne">Example: Clean up Temporary Data Sets</span>

The script in this example lists specified data sets, then loops through the list of data sets and deletes each file. You can use a similar script to clean up temporary data sets after use.

**Note:** This script must be run from a bash terminal.

```
#!/bin/bash
set -e
# Project cleanup script - deletes temporary project data sets
# Obtain the list of temporary project data sets
dslist=$(zowe files ls ds "my.project.ds*")
# Delete each data set in the list
IFS=$'\n'
for ds in $dslist
do
     echo "Deleting Temporary Project Dataset: $ds"
     zowe files delete ds "$ds" -f
done
```

### <span id="exampleTwo">Example: Submit Jobs and Save Spool Output</span>

The script in this example submits a job, waits for the job to enter output status, and saves the spool files to local files on your computer.

**Note:** This script must be run from a bash terminal.

```
#! /bin/env bash
#submit our job
jobid=$(zowe zos-jobs submit data-set "boech02.public.cntl(iefbr14)" --rff jobid --rft string)
echo "Submitted our job, JOB ID is $jobid"
#wait for job to go to output
status="UNKNOWN"
while [[ "$status" != "OUTPUT"]]; do
    echo "Checking
    status of job $jobid" status=$(zowe zos-jobs view job-status-by-jobid "$jobid" --rff status --rft string)
    echo "Current status is $status"
    sleep 5s
done;
echo "Job completed in OUTPUT status. Final result of job: "
zowe zos-jobs view job-status-by-jobid "$jobid"
# get a list of all of the spool files for our job now that it's in output
spool_ids=$(zowe zos-jobs list spool-files-by-jobid "$jobid" --rff id --rft table)
# save each spool ID to a custom file name
while read -r id; do
     zowe zos-jobs view spool-file-by-id "$jobid" "$id" > ./${jobid}_spool_${id}.txt
     echo "Saved spool DD to ./${jobid}_spool_${id}.txt"
done <<< "$spool_ids"
```
