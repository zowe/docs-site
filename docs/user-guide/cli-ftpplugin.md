## Installing

Use one of the following methods to install or update the plug-in:

- [Installing plug-ins from an online registry](cli-installplugins.md#installing-plug-ins-from-an-online-registry)

- [Installing plug-ins from a local package](cli-installplugins.md#installing-plug-ins-from-a-local-package)

## Create a User Profile

You can create a `zftp` user profile to avoid typing your connection details on every command. A `zftp` profile contains the host, port, username, and password for the z/OS instance to which you want to connect. You can create multiple profiles and switch between them as needed.

Issue the following command:

    ```
    zowe profiles create zftp <profile name> -H <host> -u <user> -p <password> -P <port>
    ```

    The result of the command displays as a success or failure message. You can use your profile when you issue commands in the `zftp` command group.

**Note:** There is an option named `--secure-ftp` that is set to `true` by default. If FTPS (FTP over SSL) is not enabled in z/OS FTP service, we recommend using `--secure-ftp false`. FTPS is not equivalent to SFTP (FTP over SSH).

**Note:** For more information about the syntax, actions, and options, for a profiles create command, open Zowe CLI and issue the following command:

```
zowe profiles create zftp -h
```
