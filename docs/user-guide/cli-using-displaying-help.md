# Displaying help

Zowe CLI has a command-line help system that details the commands, actions, and options available in the product.
## Top-level help

To view top-level help, open a command-line and issue the following command:

```
zowe --help
```

Alternatively, issue the following command to display a full list of all available commands:

```
zowe --ac
```

**Tip:** All Zowe CLI commands begin with `zowe.`

## Group, action, and object help

Append the global `--help` option to learn about a specific command group, action, or object.

For example, issue the following command to learn about the `create` action in the `zos-files` group:

```
zowe zos-files create --help
```

## Launch local web help

Launch an interactive form of help in a web browser. When you issue the following command, web help is custom-generated to include commands for all of your *currently installed* plug-ins:

```
zowe --help-web

PS C:\Users\myName> zowe --help-web
Generating web help...............done!
Launching web help in browser...
PS C:\Users\myName>
```

**Tip:** Append `--help-web` to a specific command or action to launch directly into the appropriate web help page.
