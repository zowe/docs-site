## API Mediation Layer (API ML)

### Breaking changes

| Change in  Zowe V3 | Required action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |  
|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Authentication endpoints will not support the route `/api/v1/gateway`, and instead will support only `/gateway/api/v1` | If you use the endpoints directly, change the URLs to start with `/gateway/api/v1`. If you use ZAAS client to integrate with API Mediation Layer, no action is required as the change is handled in the ZAAS client code.                                                                                                                                           |
| Spring Enabler will be updated to Spring Boot 3 and Spring 6. Spring Boot 2 and Spring 5 versions will no longer be supported | Upgrade extending services based on the Spring Enabler to Spring Boot 3 and Spring 6.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Datasets API will be archived | This service was disabled by default in Version 2. If you enable the service via `components.data-sets.enabled: true` and use the APIs documented in [Data sets Swagger](https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zowe/docs-site/docs-staging/api_definitions/datasets.json), it is necessary to move to the usage of the similar z/OSMF endpoints. |
| Jobs API will be archived | The service was disabled by default in Version 2. If you enable the service via `components.jobs.enabled: true` and use the APIs documented in [Jobs Swagger](https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zowe/docs-site/docs-staging/api_definitions/jobs.json), it is necessary to move to the usage of the similar z/OSMF endpoints.               |
| Metrics service will be archived | The service was in Technical Preview. Currently there is no replacement. In V3, the Open Telemetry standard will be implemented, which will serve as a replacement.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| IMS API will be archived | The service was not fully supported. If you were using the API, please reach out to the IBM team for follow-up steps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Java 17 will be required for the API Mediation Layer to run | For V3, it is necessary to update z/OS to version 2.5 or later as this brings support of Java 17. It is necessary to install Java 17 and provide the path to Java 17 to Zowe Java configuration.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| z/OSMF in version V2R5 with APAR PH12143 applied | If you are running a version of z/OS before 3.1, validate that the PH12143 APAR was applied to the z/OSMF installation used by Zowe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Configuration of keyrings will require transformation from `safkeyring:////` to `safkeyring://` | If your Zowe configuration contains `safkeyring:////`, change this part to `safkeyring://`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Support access to z/OSMF only through `/ibmzosmf` route. V3 will not support access through the `/zosmf` route | If you use z/OSMF via `{apimlUrl}/zosmf/{zosmfEndpoint}` you need to move to `{apimlUrl}/ibmzosmf/{zosmfEndpoint}.`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
### Important API ML updates

The current API Gateway contains the Authentication and Authorization Service. This service will be separated as a standalone service. The Authentication and Authorization Service is the only API ML service that directly requires z/OS.

## Installation and Packaging

### Breaking changes

* Dropping the original V2 configuration management, `zowe.useConfigmgr=false`. (The Configuration Manager remains as the only supported method for configuring Zowe)

### Important updates

* Removing the dependency on Node.js for configuration

## ZSS

### Breaking changes

* Run by default in 64 bit mode, `components.zss.agent.64bit=true`. 31-bit plugins cannot run in 64-bit ZSS, so you need to compile your plugins for the version of ZSS to be used. Note that only one version of ZSS can run at a time.
