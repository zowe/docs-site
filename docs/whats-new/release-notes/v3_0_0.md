| Change in Zowe V3 | Required action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |  
|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Authentication endpoints no longer support the route `/api/v1/gateway`. Only `/gateway/api/v1` is now supported. | If you use the endpoints directly, change the URLs to start with `/gateway/api/v1`. If you use ZAAS client to integrate with API Mediation Layer, no action is required as the change is handled in the ZAAS client code.                                                                                                                                           |
| Spring Enabler has been updated to Spring Boot 3 and Spring 6. Spring Boot 2 and Spring 5 versions are no longer be supported | Upgrade extending services based on the Spring Enabler to Spring Boot 3 and Spring 6.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Datasets API has been archived | This service was disabled by default in Version 2. If you enable the service via `components.data-sets.enabled: true` and use the APIs documented in [Data sets Swagger](https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zowe/docs-site/docs-staging/api_definitions/datasets.json), it is necessary to move to the usage of the similar z/OSMF endpoints. |
| Jobs API will be archived | The service was disabled by default in Version 2. If you enable the service via `components.jobs.enabled: true` and use the APIs documented in [Jobs Swagger](https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zowe/docs-site/docs-staging/api_definitions/jobs.json), it is necessary to move to the usage of the similar z/OSMF endpoints.               |
| Metrics service has been archived | The service was in Technical Preview. Currently there is no replacement. In V3, the Open Telemetry standard will be implemented, which will serve as a replacement.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| IMS API has been archived | The service was not fully supported. If you were using the API, please reach out to the IBM team for follow-up steps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Java 17 is required to run the API Mediation Layer | For V3, it is necessary to update z/OS to version 2.5 or later as this brings support of Java 17. It is necessary to install Java 17 and provide the path to Java 17 to Zowe Java configuration.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| z/OSMF in version V2R5 with APAR PH12143 applied | If you are running a version of z/OS before 3.1, validate that the PH12143 APAR was applied to the z/OSMF installation used by Zowe. The Zowe YAML parameter `components.gateway.apiml.security.auth.zosmf.jwtAutoconfiguration` for the gateway component has changed. The value `auto` is no longer allowed. Choose either the default `jwt` or `ltpa` depending on if your z/OSMF is set up for JWT use as recommended. See [example-zowe.yaml](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/blob/v3.x/staging/example-zowe.yaml) for new component values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Configuration of keyrings now requires transformation from `safkeyring:////` to `safkeyring://` | If your Zowe configuration contains `safkeyring:////`, change this part to `safkeyring://`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Support access to z/OSMF only through `/ibmzosmf` route. V3 will not support access through the `/zosmf` route | If you use z/OSMF via `{apimlUrl}/zosmf/{zosmfEndpoint}` you need to move to `{apimlUrl}/ibmzosmf/{zosmfEndpoint}.`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
#### New features and enhancements in API ML

The current API Gateway contains the Authentication and Authorization Service. This service will be separated as a standalone service. The Authentication and Authorization Service is the only API ML service that directly requires z/OS.

### ZSS

#### Breaking changes in ZSS

* ZSS now defaults to running in 64-bit mode, which requires extensions that include ZSS plugins to also have 64-bit editions. Although 64-bit is recommended to avoid 31-bit memory consumption, The YAML property `components.zss.agent.64bit=false` can be used to switch back to 31-bit if needed for extension that have not yet been updated for 64-bit. Note that only one version of ZSS can run at a time.

### Explorer for Intellij IDEA

#### New features and enhancements in Explorer for Intellij IDEA

* Explorer for IntelliJ IDEA will be part of the Zowe Core
* Working with USS Files
* Working with Data Sets
* Working with JES Working Sets
* Interactive TSO Console

### Explorer for Visual Studio Code

## Conformance and release compatibility

### Backward compatibility

Zowe V2 conformant extensions/plug-ins are not guaranteed to be compatible with Zowe V3 and therefore may not be operable. In general, plug-ins/extensions which leverage V3 APIs that have known breaking changes are at high risk of incompatibility and unpredictable results.

**Recommendation:** All V2 extenders test with Zowe V3, identify any issues, and disclose results to consumers to clearly indicate backward compatibility status in the extension documentation. If unable to test, clearly document as such.

### Forward compatibility

Zowe V3 conformant (planning to earn conformance) extensions/plug-ins are not guaranteed to be compatible with Zowe V2 LTS. In general, plug-ins/extensions with no known dependency on any newly introduced Zowe V2 functions are at minimum risk.

**Recommendation:** All V3 extenders test with Zowe V2 LTS, identify any issues, and disclose results to consumers to clearly indicate forward compatibility status in the extension documentation. If unable to test, clearly document as such.

### Conformance compatibility

Zowe V2 conformant extensions/plug-ins are likely to require changes to meet Zowe V3 conformance criteria. All extensions (regardless of V2 conformance status) must apply for V3 conformance and satisfy all required V3 testing criteria. You can find the V3 Conformance Criteria [here](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/foundation/files/8489757/Zowe.Conformance.Program.-.Test.Evaluation.Guide.Table.pdf).

**Recommendation:** All extenders interested in earning V3 conformance review the V3 conformance criteria, determine if technical changes are necessary, make appropriate modifications and prepare to apply for V3 conformance. 

**Need help?** For assistance with reviewing or completing the Zowe Conformance Zowe V3 application, reach out to members of the Zowe Onboarding Squad on Slack at https://slack.openmainframeproject.org in the `#zowe-onboarding` channel.
