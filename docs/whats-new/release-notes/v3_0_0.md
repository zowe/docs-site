## Important updates

### Zowe installation and packaging

#### Breaking changes in Zowe installation and packaging

* The original V2 configuration management, `zowe.useConfigmgr=false` has been dropped in Zowe V3. The Configuration Manager remains as the only supported method for configuring Zowe.

#### New features and enhancements in Zowe installation and packaging

* Introducing _Zowe Server Install Wizard_, a wizard to simplify installation and configuration of Zowe server side components via a UI.
* Added explanation to possible error message when checking z/OSMF setting. ([#3956](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/3956))

### Zowe Application Framework

#### Breaking changes in Zowe Application Framework

* Updated Angular to Version 18 from Version 12. Apps built upon Angular, excluding iframe apps, will need to be updated to be compatible with the V3 Desktop.

#### New features and enhancements in Zowe Application Framework
#### Zlux App Manager
* Updated the Desktop Angular version from 12 to 18.  Angular apps written for V2 will need to be upgraded to work in V3. `Iframe` and `React` is unaffected. ([#639](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-manager/pull/639))
* The V2 Desktop is included alongside the V3 Desktop as a temporary compatibility option for the duration of the V2 maintenance schedule. Any user can switch to the V2 Desktop via the `?use-v2-desktop=true` parameter. ([#639](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-manager/pull/639))

#### Zlux App Server
* Added new `pluginDefinition` property to allow plugins to simultaneously contain v2 and v3 web assets. This property, `webContent.entryPoint`, can contain a “3.0” element which states the location of the entry JS file that the Desktop would load. See the `tn3270-ng2` app for an example of its usage. ([#323](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/323)) ([#567](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/567))

#### Zowe Common C
* Added javascript `zos.getStatvfs`(path) function to obtain file system information. ([#482](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/482))
* Added support for `LE 64-bit` in isgenq.c. ([#422](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/issues/422))
* Added more arguments to `httpClientSessionInit` to allow passing back rc. ([#467](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/issues/467)) 

#### ZSS
* If no `zowe.logDirectory` is defined in config, logging is disabled. ([#726](https://github.com/zowe/ZSS/pull/726))
* Exposed new cross-memory server's functions in dynlink. ([#684](https://github.com/zowe/zss/issues/684)) 

#### Bug fixes in Zowe Application Framework
#### Zowe Common C
* `IARV64` results must be checked for `0x7FFFF000` ([#474](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/474))
* `SLH` should not `ABEND` when `MEMLIMIT` is reached (additional NULL check)
#### ZSS
* Added Support for cross-memory server parameters longer than 128 characters. ([#684](https://github.com/zowe/zss/issues/684)) 

### Known Issues
Some apps and features of V2 Desktop have not yet been added to the V3 Desktop
* The Editor app is not present on the V3 Desktop, but you can access it in the V2 desktop by including `?use-v2-desktop=true` at the end of your Desktop URL.
* Support for languages other than English is limited. You can set your language preference in the V2 desktop, but this menu is not yet present in the V3 desktop and some parts of the V3 desktop will not yet honor the language choice.
 

### API Mediation Layer (API ML)

#### Breaking changes in API ML

| Change in Zowe V3 | Required action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |  
|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Authentication endpoints no longer support the route `/api/v1/gateway`. Only `/gateway/api/v1` is now supported. | If you use the endpoints directly, change the URLs to start with `/gateway/api/v1`. If you use ZAAS client to integrate with API Mediation Layer, no action is required as the change is handled in the ZAAS client code.                                                                                                                                           |
| Spring Enabler has been updated to Spring Boot 3 and Spring 6. Spring Boot 2 and Spring 5 versions are no longer be supported | Upgrade extending services based on the Spring Enabler to Spring Boot 3 and Spring 6.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Datasets API has been archived | This service was disabled by default in Version 2. If you enable the service via `components.data-sets.enabled: true` and use the APIs documented in [Data sets Swagger](https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zowe/docs-site/docs-staging/api_definitions/datasets.json), it is necessary to move to the usage of the similar z/OSMF endpoints. |
| Jobs API will be archived | The service was disabled by default in Version 2. If you enable the service via `components.jobs.enabled: true` and use the APIs documented in [Jobs Swagger](https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zowe/docs-site/docs-staging/api_definitions/jobs.json), it is necessary to move to the usage of the similar z/OSMF endpoints.               |
| Metrics service has been archived | The service was in Technical Preview. Currently there is no replacement. In V3, the Open Telemetry standard will be implemented, which will serve as a replacement.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| IMS API has been archived | The service was not fully supported. If you were using the API, please reach out to the IBM team for follow-up steps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Java 17 is required to run the API Mediation Layer | For V3, it is necessary to update z/OS to version 2.5 or later as this brings support of Java 17. It is necessary to install Java 17 and provide the path to Java 17 to Zowe Java configuration.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| z/OSMF in version V2R5 with APAR PH12143 applied | If you are running a version of z/OS before 3.1, validate that the PH12143 APAR was applied to the z/OSMF installation used by Zowe. The Zowe YAML parameter `components.gateway.apiml.security.auth.zosmf.jwtAutoconfiguration` for the gateway component has changed. The value `auto` is no longer allowed. Choose either the default `jwt` or `ltpa` depending on if your z/OSMF is set up for JWT use as recommended. See [example-zowe.yaml](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/blob/v3.x/staging/example-zowe.yaml) for new component values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Configuration of keyrings now requires transformation from `safkeyring:////` to `safkeyring://` | If your Zowe configuration contains `safkeyring:////`, change this part to `safkeyring://`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Support access to z/OSMF only through `/ibmzosmf` route. V3 will not support access through the `/zosmf` route | If you use z/OSMF via `{apimlUrl}/zosmf/{zosmfEndpoint}` you need to move to `{apimlUrl}/ibmzosmf/{zosmfEndpoint}.`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
