### Zowe installation and packaging

- Component installation can now print stdout of install scripts. ([#3361](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/3361))

### Zowe Application Framework

#### ZSS

- Added the API `/datasetCopy` to copy data sets.
- `/datasetMetadata` now returns prime, secnd, and space fields for showing the primary and secondary extent sizes and the unit type for them. ([#582](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/582))
- ZSS data set creation API now supports space values of `BYTE`, `KB`, and `MB`, instead of just `CYL` and `TRK`.

#### Zowe Common C 

- `fileCopy` now copies with the target having the permissions of the source, as opposed to the previous 700 permissions.

#### Zlux App Manager 

- Added new `isSingleAppModeSimple()` to `iframe-adapter` to differentiate between **standalone mode** and **simple standalone mode**.
- Replaced existing snapshot preview with lighter UI to significantly increase multi-app Desktop performance.

#### Zlux Server Framework 

- Added support for `zowe.verifyCertificates=NONSTRICT`. ([#468](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/468))
- Allow dataservices to pass CAs into the `call()` function. ([#462](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/462))

#### Zlux Editor

- Renamed `openFile` to `openBuffer` in `editor-control.serverice.ts`.

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

- A unique authentication cookie name has been added for multi-instance deployment (#2812) ([6654271](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/commit/6654271)), closes [#2812](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2812).

### Zowe CLI

#### Zowe CLI (Core)

- Updated Imperative to add `--prune` option to `zowe config secure` command to delete unused properties. ([Imperative #547](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/547))
- Added `range` option to `zos-files view uss-file` command.

#### Imperative CLI Framework

- Added `--prune` option to `zowe config secure` command to delete unused properties. ([#547](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/547))

- Added `credMgrOverride` property to `IProfOpts` interface that can be used to override credential manager in the `ProfileInfo` API. ([Zowe CLI #1632](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1632))
- Deprecated the `requireKeytar` property on the `IProfOpts` interface. Use the `credMgrOverride` property instead and pass the callback that requires Keytar to `ProfileCredentials.defaultCredMgrWithKeytar`.
- Added `AbstractPluginLifeCycle` to enable plug-ins to write their own `postInstall` and `preUninstall` functions, which will be automatically called by the Zowe plug-in's `install` and `uninstall` commands.
- Added `pluginLifeCycle` property to `IImperativeConfig` to enable a plug-in to specify the path name to its own module which implements the `AbstractPluginLifeCycle` class.
- Added a list of known credential manager overrides to Imperative. When a credential manager cannot be loaded, a list of valid credential managers displays in an error message.
- Added a `CredentialManagerOverride` class containing utility functions to replace the default CLI credential manager or restore the default CLI credential manager. Plug-ins which implement a credential manager override can call these utilities from their `AbstractPluginLifeCycle` functions.
- Added documentation [Overriding_the_default_credential_manager](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/blob/master/doc/Plugin%20Architecture/Overriding_the_default_credential_manager.md) describing the techniques for overriding the default CLI credential manager with a plug-in.

#### z/OS FTP Plug-in for Zowe CLI

- Updated example of `upload file-to-data-set` command in the plug-in help.

### Zowe Explorer

- Added a new Zowe Explorer setting, `zowe.logger`, with a default setting of `INFO` to allow users to select the level of logging they want to see. Logging levels range from TRACE (most verbose) to FATAL (only fatal).

- Added an output channel, `Zowe Explorer`, for logging within VS Code's Output view so users can view Zowe Explorer logs within VS Code. The log level is set by the new Zowe Explorer setting, `zowe.logger`.
- Opening a dialog for Upload or Download of files will now open at the project level directory or the user's home directory if no project is opened. ([#2203](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-explorer-vscode/issues/2203))
- Updated linter rules and addressed linter errors throughout the codebase. ([#2184](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-explorer-vscode/issues/2184))
- Added the new setting `zowe.files.logsFolder.path` that can be used to override the Zowe Explorer logs folder if the default location is read-only. ([#2186](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-explorer-vscode/issues/2186))
## Bug fixes

Zowe Version 2.8.0 contains the bug fixes that are described in the following topics.

### Zowe installation and packaging

- Component environment variables will not be aliased to the `configs` shorthand when the component had a configure script, but not a validate script, and `zowe.useConfigmgr` was enabled.

- When `zowe.useConfigmgr=true`, component installation will not run the installation script from the component root directory, but instead from the place `zwe` was executed, causing relative path differences versus `zowe.useConfigmgr=false`.

### Zowe Application Framework
#### ZSS

- Changed conflicting message IDs in the ZIS dynamic linkage base plug-in.

#### Zowe Common C 

- `fileCopy` would not work when convert encoding was not requested. The destination file would be created, but without the requested content.
- `respondWithUnixFileMetadata` would not return UID or GID of a file if the id-to-name mapping failed, which is possible when an account is removed.

#### Zlux App Manager 

- Fixed the iframe-adapter not properly recognizing **standalone mode**.
- Fixed Iframes from unintentionally loading their sources multiple times during refocus and multi-app situations.

#### Zlux Editor

- Fixed app2app `openDataset` function.
- Renamed `openFile` to `openBuffer` in `editor-control.serverice.ts`.
