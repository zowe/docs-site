## New features and enhancements

Zowe Version 2.18.2 contains the enhancements that are described in the following topics.

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

- The configuration property **`apiml.security.forwardHeader.trustedProxies`** has been added to specify the regular expression pattern used to identify trusted proxies from which `X-Forwarded-*` headers are accepted and forwarded. This mitigates CVE-2025-41235. The API ML gateways (incl. cloud gateways) in [Multitenancy Configuration](/user-guide/api-mediation/api-mediation-multi-tenancy) are trusted by default. ([#4148](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/pull/4148) and [#4188](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/pull/4188))
- A Java sample app has been added to assist users to authenticate client certificates. ([#4009](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4009))
- Users can now configure the connect and read timeout for Eureka HTTP client. ([#4046](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4046))
- Java 21 is now supported. ([#4027](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4027))
