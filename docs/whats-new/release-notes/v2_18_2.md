## New features and enhancements

Zowe Version 2.18.2 contains the enhancements that are described in the following topics:

### Zowe Application Framework

#### ZSS
* z/OS 3.2 is now supported. ([#538](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/538))

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

- The configuration property `apiml.security.forwardHeader.trustedProxies` has been added to specify the regular expression pattern used to identify trusted proxies from which `X-Forwarded-*` headers are accepted and forwarded. This mitigates CVE-2025-41235. The API ML gateways (including cloud gateways) in [Multitenancy Configuration](/user-guide/api-mediation/api-mediation-multi-tenancy) are trusted by default. ([#4148](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/pull/4148) and [#4188](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/pull/4188))
- A Java sample app has been added to assist users to authenticate client certificates. ([#4009](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4009))
- Users can now configure the `connectTimeout` and `readTimeout` for Eureka HTTP client. ([#4046](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4046))
- Java 21 is now supported. ([#4027](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4027))

## Bug fixes

Zowe Version 2.18.2 contains the bug fixes that are described in the following topics:

### Zowe Application Framework

- Fixed an issue of the API Catalog by introducing a workaround. Before the fix, the API Catalog attempted to establish two secure Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections while the API Catalog operated under AT-TLS. Since AT-TLS already handled the secure communication, the attempt by the API Catalog was unnecessary and led to performance overheads or failures in communication. After the fix, the registration information of the API Catalog updates the Eureka client system to indicate to other systems that AT-TLS is in use and provides secure communication. This ensures that the API Catalog and the other services interacting with it recognize the existing secure environment that AT-TLS provides and the API Catalog avoids unnecessary security processing. ([#609](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/609))

### ZSS

- Fixed an issue where the HTTP client software was unable to handle `EWOULDBLOCK` errors while processing data from AT-TLS in Zowe. The fix introduced `HTTP_CLIENT_UNBLOCKED_TRY_AGAIN (19)` and `HTTP_CLIENT_SOCKET_TIMEOUT (20)` error codes into the HTTP client software to enable the HTTP client software to handle the `EWOULDBLOCK` errors with greater efficiency. ([#534](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/534))

- Fixed an issue where there was a delay in the response from the Gateway after HTTP or AT-TLS contacted the Gateway for Single Sign On(SSO). After the fix, if HTTP or AT-TLS contacts the Gateway for SSO, the Gateway provides an immediate response. ([#775](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/775)), ([#772](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/772))

- Fixed an issue where Zowe, when installed on the z/OS operating system, stopped working because that version of z/OS changed or upgraded. After the fix, Zowe continues to work uninterrupted even if the version of the underlying z/OS changes or upgrades. ([#780](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/780))

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

- Fixed gateway returning empty auth keys from z/OSMF when `apiml.security.auth.zosmf.jwtAutoconfiguration` is set to `jwt`. ([#4092](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4092))
- Fixed an error where NPE in `ApimlPeerEurekaNode` stops heartbeats. ([#4195](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/pull/4195))
- Fixed logout implementation in API Catalog in which cookies from the browser were deleted but JWT against the Gateway instance of the Zowe installation are not invalidated. ([#4185](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/pull/4185))
- Applied fix for disabling infinispan diagnostics by default. ([#4170](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/pull/4170))
- Fixed a resource leak in the http client, whereby all objects are now closed after use. ([#4153](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/pull/4153))
- Added HSTS header when AT-TLS enabled for V2. ([#4071](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4071))
- Changed error code SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE to INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR when ticket generation fails. ([#4043](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4043))

- Updated `tar-fs` transitive dependency to resolve technical debt. ([#177](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-db2-plugin/pull/177))
