:::

### Zowe Install Packaging
* Reduced resource consumption by removal of one shell process per server that was used when starting each server. ([#3812](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/3812))
* The command `zwe support` now includes `CEE Runtime` option output to better diagnose issues related to environment customization. ([#3799](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/3799))


### Zowe Application Framework

#### Zowe Common C
* No YAML value converted to null. ([#442](https://github.com/zowe/Zowe-Common-C/pull/442))
* Added `zos.getZosVersion()` and `zos.getEsm()` calls for `configmgr QJS`. ([#429](https://github.com/zowe/Zowe-Common-C/pull/429))
* For correct `base64` encoding scheme the buffer size is made to be divisible by 3. ([#431](https://github.com/zowe/Zowe-Common-C/pull/431))
* Now the leap seconds are taken into account in `xmem log messages' timestamps`. ([#432](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/issues/432)), ([#433](https://github.com/zowe/Zowe-Common-C/pull/433))
* Using a temporary buffer pointer to avoid pointer corruption during file write. ([#437](https://github.com/zowe/Zowe-Common-C/pull/437)).

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

* The log message `ZWEAM001I` is now issued when API Mediation Layer starts. ([#3523](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3523))
* SSL is now disabled when profile `attls` is active to simplify AT-TLS configuration. ([#3521](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3521]))
* Valid OIDC tokens are now forwarded to the downstream service when the distributed ID is not mapped. ([#3497](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3497))
* Included OIDC JWKSet in the gateway JWKs. JWKs retrieved from the Identity Provider allow clients and services to validate the OIDC access token locally. ([#3499](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3499))
* Moved OIDC access token from cookie to special header. If the user ID from the token cannot be mapped to a mainframe account, the access token is now sent via the request header OIDC-token. ([#3513](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3513))

## Bug fixes

Zowe Version 2.16.0 contains the bug fixes that are described in the following topics.

### Zowe Install Packaging
* `zowe.network.validatePortFree` and `zowe.network.vipaIp` variables were moved from `zowe.network` to `zowe.network.server` in the schema but not in the code, causing inability to use them without the workaround of specifying them as environment variables ZWE_NETWORK_VALIDATE_PORT_FREE and ZWE_NETWORK_VIPA_IP instead. Now, the variables match the schema: `zowe.network.server` is used instead of `zowe.network`. ([#3784](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/3784))
* `configmgr` operations now run with `HEAPPOOLS64` set to `OFF` to avoid abends caused when this parameter is not `OFF`. ([#3799](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/3799))


### Zowe Application Framework

#### Zluz App Server
* Removed message saying node not found prior to discovery of node. Now, you will only get an error message if node is not found after lookup in `NODE_HOME`. ([#301](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/301))

#### ZSS
* `AUX` should take leap seconds into account in their `log messages' timestamp`. ([#690](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/690)), ([#691](https://github.com/zowe/zss/issues/691))

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

* Allow key exchange port configuration ([#3453](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3453))
* Changed the scheme of the service homepage when AT-TLS is enabled and fix a bug in the UI. ([#3346](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3346))
* Checked for NullPointerException when the JWK key cannot be retrieved. ([#3503](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3503))
* Fixed an issue when PAT passed as the authorization header with the auth scheme zoweJwt ([#3505](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3505))
* Fixed the header position in the API Catalog. ([#3345](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3345))
* Fixed the log message about unauthorized calls. ([#3326](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3326))
* Allow for more general exception handling to detect TCP Stack restart. ([#3462](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3462))
* Fixed configuration enabling JWT Token Refresh Functionality. ([#3474](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3474))
