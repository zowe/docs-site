## New features and enhancements

Zowe Version 3.2.0 contains the enhancements that are described in the following topics.

### Server Install

- Added an enhancement so that the `zwe` support command collects more environment details. ([#4147](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4147))
- Added an enhancement in the form of a new library function named `formatZosVersion()` in zosUtils to standardize the formatting of z/OS versions during installation checks. ([#4134](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4134)) 
- Added an enhancement so that when you run the `zwe support verify-fingerprints` command, you no longer have to specify a configuration file, such as `zowe.yaml`, as a command-line parameter. ([#4147](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4147))

### Zowe Application Framework

- Added an enhancement to compress the Zowe v3 Desktop assets so that the Desktop can load faster on a slow internet connection with a slow network speed.
- Added an enhancement to compress the size of assets within the Zowe v3 Desktop so that the Desktop loads faster despite a slow internet connection. The enhancement increases the speed of loading the desktop. ([#658](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-manager/pull/658))
- Added an enhancement to validate certificate properties on startup, ensuring a secure and valid configuration. ([#338](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/338))

### ZSS

- Added a new feature with a `modify` command to display module registry information. Users can use the information to easily monitor, troubleshoot, and manage the current state of registered modules. ([#519](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/519))
- Added a feature to reset the module registry at cross-memory server startup, ensuring a clean and consistent environment for the server’s operation by clearing outdated data and reducing the risk of errors caused by stale module configurations. ([#754](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/754))
- Added an enhancement to include the stub version in the generated HLASM stub, enabling improved version tracking and compatibility. ([#743](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/743))
- Added an enhancement to expose new `cmutils` functions, providing additional capabilities for managing and interacting with system components. ([#740](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/740))
- Added support for passing multiple parameters to Zowe Integration Server (ZIS) via the `START` command.
This is an enhancement on its own, all it means is there is more flexibility available for configuration at start up. The `START` command is mostly run from a terminal window or CLI on the system where Zowe is installed. ([#753](https://github.com/zowe/zss/issues/753)), ([#755](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/755))
- Added a parameter to reset the module registry at ZIS startup, preventing issues with outdated or conflicting module data. ([#519](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/519))
- Added an enhancement to make the `modregReset` function available through dynlink, enabling dynamic linking for module registry resets. ([#754](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/754))

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

## Bug fixes

Zowe Version 3.2.0 contains the bug fixes that are described in the following topics:

### Zowe Application Framework

- Fixed an issue where it was not possible to configure the app-server as the configuration property `components.app-server.node.mediationLayer.eureka` was not documented in the schema. ([#336](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/336))
- Fixed an issue that prevented the Desktop from selecting the most efficient and direct route to access ZSS. After the fix, the Desktop has the necessary information to identify and use a direct route to access ZSS. ([#588](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/588))
- Fixed an issue that caused a large memory consumption and a high memory utilization after every startup. The issue was due to a defect in the `axios` library. The functionality of the app-servers does not alter due to this change. ([#600](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/600))
- Fixed an issue where troubleshooting information became unavailable when there was a network failure during the eureka registration process. The `components.app-server.node.mediationLayer.traceTls` property was introduced to troubleshoot TLS issues. The property can trace the connection the app-server forms with the discovery server, revealing the cause of low-level networking issues. ([#592](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/592))

### ZSS

- Storage has now been configured to allow execution with the `EXECUTABLE=YES` setting, which enables the specified storage to be used as executable code. This is typically done to allow the storage to hold executable programs or modules. ([#507](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/507))
- Fixed a memory leak in the rsusermap code, preventing unnecessary memory consumption and improving system performance. ([#467](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/issues/467))
- Enabled the use of single-line WTOs for efficient handling of single-line system console messages and improving the readability of generated system logs. ([#509](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/issues/509))
- Ensured that Zowe does not delete `modreg` based modules, thus preventing the loss of critical module data.
([#749](https://github.com/zowe/zss/issues/749))
- Fixed an issue where the schema entry for JWT tracing was being updated with an incorrect name `_zss.jwt`. After the fix, the schema entry is updated with the correct name `_zss.jwtTrace`, which helps users to identify the log level that can enable JWT tracing. ([#757](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/757))
- Corrected the `modregRegister` entry in the dynlink stub. ([#754](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/754))
- Fixed the incorrect checking of the look-up anchor reset parameter. ([#754](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/754))
- Fixed an issue where ZSS was not accessible from the Gateway when a user used AT-TLS. After the fix, ZSS is accessible from the Gateway if a user uses AT-TLS. ([#758](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/758))

* Updated ciphers list v3. ([#4025](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4025))
* Fixed the file log appender for debug profile. ([#4020](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4020))
* Improved WebSocket generic 500 response in message. ([#4019](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4019))
* Special characters are now allowed in url. ([#4008](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4008))
* Introduced a workaround for API Catalog redirect behavior in the Desktop. ([#4007](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4007))

* Added newPassword to the Swagger. ([#3999](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3999))
* Authorization header is now supported in deterministic routing. ([#3998](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3998))
* The TLS minimum setting has been fixed supporting TLSv1.2 as the minimum with TLSv1.3 supported by default. ([#3993](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3993))
* Updated the React router to v7. ([#3977](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3977))
* Replaced default Spring x509 Authentication in ZAAS. ([#3971](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3971))
* HA instance ID is now used in the path to infinispan storage location (v3). ([#3960](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3960))

### Zowe CLI

#### Zowe CLI (Core)

- Updated the Daemon binary version for technical currency. ([#2479](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2479))
- Fixed a bug that resulted in daemon commands running slower with every additional command. ([#2470](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2470))
- Fixed the `--show-inputs-only` option on commands with chained command handlers, such as `zowe zos-files copy data-set-cross-lpar`. ([#2446](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2446))
- When using the `copy` command, if a target partitioned data set has a smaller record length than a source partitioned data set, the operation for subsequent members no longer stops. The user can now view the affected members in a local file. ([#2349](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2349))
- Users were not warned when copying partitioned data sets with identical member names. Now, the user is prompted to confirm before continuing the copy operation to avoid potential data loss. ([#2349](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2349))
- The `zowe zos-files copy data-set` command overwrites the contents of the target data set without user confirmation. A `--safe-replace` option was added to prompt the user to confirm before overwriting the contents of the target data set. ([#2369](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2369))

#### Zowe CLI Imperative Framework

- Ensured that the `ProfileCredentials` class evaluates all layers to determine if the user's credentials are secure. ([#2460](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2460))
- Fixed a bug that resulted in daemon commands running slower with every additional command. ([#2470](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2470))
- When in daemon mode, the user would not see Imperative initialization errors, but now the errors are passed back to the user's terminal window. ([#1875](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1875)).
- Fixed the `--show-inputs-only` option on commands with chained command handlers. ([#2446](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2446))
- Fixed the help text example section's wrapping issue where the first line of the description is wrapped differently than the rest of the lines. ([#1945](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1945)).
- Fixed inconsistent behavior with the `ZOWE_SHOW_SECURE_ARGS` environment variable continuing to mask secure properties when it should not. ([#2430](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2430))
