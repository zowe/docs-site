### Zowe installation and packaging

### Zowe Application Framework

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

* The external URL is now overridden for additional registration. ([#3935](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3935))
* OIDC token (Okta token) is now supported for authentication in API Catalog. ([#3925](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3925))
* Topology of API ML services on multiple sysplexes is now supported wherein certificates can be obtained from multiple sources. This feature allows communication to start on any sysplex and going through any sysplex to any other sysplex. [#3914](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3914)
* Users can now set the number of concurrent requests to be routed at the same time to a specific service. The feature: "Limit API usage" is part of this solution. ([#3903](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3903))
* Limit API usage. A custom inmemory rate limiter has been added to limit usage of predefined services. ([#3868](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3868))
* A validate OIDC token call to ZAAS client has been added to validate OIDC via ZAAS client. ([#3897](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3897))
* A Java sample has been added to show how to build a Java application that uses a client certificate to authenticate against API ML. ([#3862](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3862))
* A client AT-TLS setting is now supported. ([#3828](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3828)) 


### Zowe CLI

#### Zowe CLI (Core)

- The `zowe zos-files copy data-set` command now copies members from a source partitioned data set to an existing target partitioned data set. ([#2386](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2386))

- Add the new `--ignore-not-found` flag to avoid file-not-found error messages when deleting files so scripts are not interrupted during automated batch processing. The flag bypasses warning prompts to confirm delete actions. ([#2254](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2254))
- Added the `--wait-for-active` and `--wait-for-output` flags to download options for the `zos-jobs` command group. ([#2328](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2328))

- Added optional `--attributes` flag to the `zowe zos-files upload file-to-uss` command to allow passing a `.zosattributes` file path for upload encoding format. ([#2319](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2319))
- Issue the `zowe files search data-sets` command with the new `--encoding` option to use a different code page when searching data set contents. ([#2161](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2161))
- Add the new `--stateful` flag to `zos-tso issue cmd` to allow declaring the statefulness of the address space being created. ([#2240](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2240))
- To minimize the amount of unnecessary text returned from TSO commands, the `--suppress-startup-messages` flag default value changed to `true`. ([#2240](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2240))

#### Zowe CLI Imperative Framework

- Added the `DeferredPromise` class to Imperative to provide utilities for data synchronization. ([#2405](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2405))
