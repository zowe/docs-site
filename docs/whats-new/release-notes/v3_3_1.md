## Bug fixes

Zowe Version 3.3.1 contains the bug fixes that are described in the following topics.

### Zowe installation and packaging

 * Added scheme information to the z/OSMF static definition. If connections to z/OSMF do not follow AT-TLS rules, AT-TLS uses the scheme information to establish connections and can then operate in hybrid scenarios. [#4512](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4512)

### Zowe Application Framework

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

* Encoded slashes in redirect header are now accepted. ([#4328](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4328))
* Introduced the OIDC redirectUri default in java code to prevent a startup error. ([#4329](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4329))
* Missing properties have been introduced to properly handle scenarios in which z/OSMF is configured to use https or http schemes even when AT-TLS is enabled at the Zowe level. This fix creates a z/OSMF static definition for AT-TLS. ([#4327](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4327))
* Implemented a Custom Disk Health Configuration to work properly on zOS. ([#4268](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4268), ([#4269](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4268))
