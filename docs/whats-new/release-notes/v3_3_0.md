## New features and enhancements

Zowe Version 3.3.0 contains the enhancements that are described in the following topics:

### Server Install

- A new utility `certificate-analyser.jar` has been added to the folder `zowe/bin/utils`. This tool will eventually be used to verify correct certificates for use by Zowe, as well as correct connectivity to servers Zowe communicates with such as z/OSMF. In a future release, the tool is intended to be used by Zowe under specific circumstances to verify whether the network setup is correct. ([#4354](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4354))
- Enhanced the `ZWEGENER` job to support Configuration Manager path elements of type `PARMLIB` that can contain one or multiple members with different names within the same `PARMLIB` dataset. The new format is `PARMLIB(DATA.SET(member))`. This is an alternative format to the older format. ([#4332](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4332))
- Updated the `zowe-yaml-schema.json` and `defaults.yaml` to support a new configuration parameter `zowe.sysMessageTrim` and set a default value. This parameter is used to trim syslog messages and print only from the sys-message-id. ([#4294](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4294))
- `zwe install` and `zwe init` commands can alternatively use `ZWEGENER` to create and submit JCL during Zowe's install and configuration, rather than using USS commands and utilities. `--dry-run` can be used to generate JCL without submitting it, allowing users to review the JCL and optionally submit it themselves. This is a technical preview feature. ([#4282](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4282), [#4107](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4107), [#4429](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4429), [#4427](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4427))
-	A new parameter `zowe.setup.jcl.header` can now be used to specify Job Card information in the JCL generated by `ZWEGENER`. ([#4423](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4423))
-	Support has been added for API Mediation Layer (API ML) in modulith mode, allowing it to run as a single JVM process. This feature is provided as a technical preview. ([#4254](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4254))

### Zowe Application Framework

#### Zlux Server Framework
- The App-server no longer prints codes `ZWED0036I`, `54I`, `55I`, `62I-68I`. These codes are now only shown in bootstrap or install debug logs, to clean up the job log. ([#608](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/608))

#### Zlux App-Server
-	App-server now handles when the components.apiml.enabled option is set to true as an alternative to enabling  `gateway`, `discovery`, and `caching-service` components. ([#345](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/345))

### Zowe Common C
-	Added a new function `copyConfigurationAndDeleteKey` to Configuration Manager for making revisions to configurations. ([#524](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/524))
-	Configuration Manager path elements of type PARMLIB can now contain one or multiple members with different names within the same PARMLIB dataset. The new format is `PARMLIB(DATA.SET(member))`. This is an alternative format to the older format wherein the member name was specified in a separate argument. The old format was to specify `PARMLIB(DATA.SET)` and then specify the member name. See https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/configmgr-using for more information. ([#522](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/522))

### ZSS
- Added a utility `zis-test` that determines whether ZIS is running and accessible by Zowe  before starting ZSS. This utility is located within the `bin/utils` folder of the Zowe runtime directory and can be used by extenders or during troubleshooting to check the ZIS status as needed. ([#764](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/764))
- The `bind-test` utility is now available in Zowe. This utility is located within the `bin/utils` folder of the Zowe runtime directory and can be used by extenders or during troubleshooting to validate the network and network permissions as needed. ([#764](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/764))
-	ZSS now handles when the `components.apiml.enabled` option is set to `true` as an alternative to enabling  `gateway`, `discovery`, and `caching-service` components. ([#787](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/787))

### Basic TN3270 Display Emulator
- The Logical Unit name is now displayed in the TN3270 window title, making it easier for users to identify the session they are working with. ([#101](https://github.com/zowe/tn3270-ng2/pull/101))

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

* You can now deploy API ML as a single service. ([#3973](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3973))
* Added the configuration property **`apiml.security.forwardHeader.trustedProxies`** to specify the regular expression pattern used to identify trusted proxies from which `X-Forwarded-*` headers are accepted and forwarded. Mitigates CVE-2025-41235. ([#4171](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/pull/4171))
* Zowe now supports an independent response time route setting. ([#3981](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3981))
* Added a check of the certificate signing algorithm in the Certificate Analyzer tool. ([#4121](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4121))
* Made certificate validation improvements. ([#4017](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4017))
* Added the Onboarding Python Enabler. ([#4068](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4068))
* Users are now allowed to configure the connect and read timeout for the Eureka HTTP client. ([#4045](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4045))

### Zowe CLI

#### Zowe CLI (Core)

- Replaced logic in `ApimlAuthHandler.processLogin` with a call to a new common function, `AuthOrder.putNewAuthsFirstOnDisk`. There are no changes to the external API and no changes to the functionality. ([#2568](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2568))
- Added a `search-exact-name` option to the `zowe zos-files search data-set` command to search the contents of one data set or PDS. ([#2529](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2529))
- Added a new configuration property named `authOrder` with which a user can specify a desired choice of authentication. ([#1794](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1794))
- Updated Node.js types for technical currency. ([#2511](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2511))
- Added the `--establish-connection-timeout` option to the `z/OSMF Connection Options`. This allows users to specify a maximum limit for how long the REST client should attempt to establish a connection to the server, and returns an error if the request takes too long. ([#2490](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2490))
- Added the `--completion-timeout` option to the `z/OSMF Connection Options`. This allows users to specify a maximum limit for how long a REST request should take, and returns an error if the request takes too long. ([#2490](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2490))
- Updated help examples to replace short option aliases (for example, `-h`) with full option names (for example, `--help`) for improved clarity and consistency in documentation. ([#2484](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2484))
- Added the ability to search data sets with regex patterns by passing `--regex` into the search command. ([#2432](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2432))
- Added the `--overwrite` flag to the `zowe files copy ds` command to allow for overwriting all members of a target data set with source data set members. ([#2450](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2450))
- Added the ability to see secure properties when running `zowe config list` when the `ZOWE_SHOW_SECURE_ARGS` environment variable is set to `true`. ([#2259](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2259))
- Added the `--data-set-type` flag to create sequential data set command to allow for creating extended and large formatted sequential data sets. ([#2141](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2141))
- Added the `--recordRange` flag to the `zowe jobs download output` command to allow users to select a specific range of records to output from a spool file. ([#2411](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2411))

#### Zowe CLI Imperative Framework

- Added the following `AuthOrder` functions: `getPropNmFor`, `putNewAuthsFirstInSess`, `putNewAuthsFirstOnDisk`, `formNewAuthOrderArray`, `authArrayToCfgVal`, `authCfgValToArray`. No external behavior is changed by this addition to/refactoring of the Zowe SDK logic. ([#2568](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2568))
- When no credentials are available, added prompt for the credentials related to the first entry in the `authOrder` property instead of arbitrarily prompting for user and password. ([#2568](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2568))
- Reordered `authOrder` information in error messages to be easier for a user to follow the effect of the `authOrder`. ([#2568](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2568))
- Added `--verbose` option to the `zowe plugins install` command to make debugging easier. ([#2562](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2562))
- Added `spawnWithInheritedStdio` method to `ExecUtils` which inherits output instead of piping it. ([#2562](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2562))
- Updated the Zowe Client REST APIs to obey the choice of authentication specified by a user. ([#2491](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2491))
- Updated the `Logger` class to support the `winston` library, and introduced migration tools to switch from `log4js` to `winston`. For more information on how to migrate your logger instance to use the `winston` library, refer to the ["Configuring logging" page](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/wiki/Configuring-Logging) on the Zowe CLI wiki. ([#2488](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2488))
- Added a request timeout to the Imperative REST client. ([#2490](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2490))
- Added the `ZOWE_REQUEST_COMPLETION_TIMEOUT` environment variable to the `EnvironmentalVariableSettings` class to allow extenders to determine how long to wait for a request to complete before timing out. ([#2490](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2490))
- Added a connection timeout to the Imperative REST Client, with a default of 60 seconds. ([#2486](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2486))
- Added the `ZOWE_SOCKET_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` environment variable to the `EnvironmentalVariableSettings` class to allow extenders to determine how long to wait for a socket connection before timing out. ([#2486](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2486))
- Updated help examples to replace short option aliases (for example, `-h`) with full option names (for example, `--help`) for improved clarity and consistency in documentation. ([#2484](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2484))
- Exposed the private `buildPrefix` function as a replacement of `moment.format(...)`. ([#2478](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2478))

#### CICS Plug-in for Zowe CLI

- Added the ability to define bundles. ([#72](https://github.com/zowe/cics-for-zowe-client/issues/72))

## Bug fixes

Zowe Version 3.3.0 contains the bug fixes that are described in the following topics:

### Server Install

-	YAML lookup for HA instances within `haInstances` is now case insensitive and works regardless of whether the letters of the HA instance names are in uppercase or lowercase. ([#4370](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4370))
-	`ZWEGENER` now aborts with an error message if `zowe.setup.dataset.prefix` or `zowe.setup.dataset.jcllib` are undefined or identical, preventing potential runtime errors. ([#4337](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4337))

### Zowe Application Framework

#### Zlux Server Framework
- Introduced a workaround for API Catalog issuing a double-TLS request when the API Catalog was under AT-TLS by changing eureka registration content to match the state of API Catalog. ([#610](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/610))

### Zowe Common C
-	Fixed a memory leak in the `safeFree64Internal` function for 64 bit programs. ([#540](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/540))

### ZSS
- Fixed an issue wherein if AT-TLS was enabled for ZSS and ZSS was unable to communicate with the APIML Gateway, the JWK initialization logic entered a continuous loop and consumed a large amount of CPU resources. ([#772](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/772))
- ZSS now is compatible with z/OS 3.2. ([#781](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/781))

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

### Zowe CLI

#### Zowe CLI (Core)

- Added a warning to users using a TSO command. It now warns them that a logon procedure is not being used when a non default logon procedure and `--ssm` option is used. ([#2528](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-explorer-vscode/issues/2528))
- Fixed an issue where inconsistent formatting for an example in the `zowe zos-files create data-set-sequential` command caused the example to be improperly displayed in the Zowe web help. Now, the full example command is shown in the code block when displayed through the web help. ([#2557](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2557))
- Updated the `brace-expansion` dependency for technical currency. ([#2523](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2523))
- Added update to avoid prompting for a password when a token is available for authentication. ([#2500](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2500))
- Updated the `zowe auth login apiml` command to place its retrieved token into the specified (or default) base profile instead of creating a new base profile.  The update also places a directive to use token authentication for the default `zosmf` profile if that profile is configured to connect to API-ML. ([#2181](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2181), [#1650](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1650))
- Updated the Daemon binary version for technical currency. ([#2479](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2479))
- Fixed a bug that resulted in daemon commands running slower with every additional command. ([#2470](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2470))
- Fixed the `--show-inputs-only` option on commands with chained command handlers, such as `zowe zos-files copy data-set-cross-lpar`. ([#2446](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2446))
- When using the `copy` command, if a target partitioned data set has a smaller record length than a source partitioned data set, the operation for subsequent members no longer stops. The user can now view the affected members in a local file. ([#2349](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2349))
- Fixed a bug where users were not warned when copying partitioned data sets with identical member names. Now, the user is prompted to confirm before continuing the copy operation to avoid potential data loss. ([#2349](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2349))
- Fixed a bug where the `zowe zos-files copy data-set` command would overwrite the contents of the target data set without user confirmation. A `--safe-replace` option was added which prompts the user to confirm before overwriting the contents of the target data set. ([#2369](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2369))

#### Zowe CLI Imperative Framework

- Added a validity check in the `ProfileInfo` class `mergeArgsForProfile` method to ensure the base profile exists before merging its values. This prevents Zowe Explorer UI loading errors when a non-existent base profile is referenced. ([#2575](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2575))
- Fixed invalid value for npm log level when `--verbose` option is true on the `zowe plugins install` command. ([#2571](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2571))
- Updated the web help generator logic to fix links with special characters. ([#2553](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2553), [#2308](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2308))
- Resolved an issue where streaming uploads of special characters could result in data corruption at chunk boundaries. ([#2556](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2555))
- Fixed an issue with the `zowe config` commands to ensure correct user input handling. ([#2519](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2519))
- Updated the `brace-expansion` dependency for technical currency. ([#2523](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2523))
- Fixed an issue where Imperative integration tests can fail due to a missing `glob` dependency. ([#2511](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2511))
- Fixed an issue where downstream dependencies using `log4js` have their log output redirected after creating an instance of the `ProfileInfo` class. ([#2488](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2488))
- Added checks to the `AbstractRestClient` abstract class to ensure the `hostname` parameter does not contain a protocol. ([#2486](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2486))

#### DB2 Plug-in for Zowe CLI

- Updated the `form-data` dependency for technical currency. ([#185](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-db2-plugin/pull/185))
- Updated the `ibm_db` dependency to fix an issue with offline installation. ([#183](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-db2-plugin/issues/183))
