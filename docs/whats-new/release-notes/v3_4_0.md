## New features and enhancements

Zowe Version 3.4.0 contains the enhancements that are described in the following topics:

### Server Install

* API ML now uses `saf` as its default authentication provider for new installations of Zowe. ([#4573](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4573))
* The `zwe validate config` command has been added as an alias of `zwe config validate` for naming consistency with future `zwe validate` commands. The `zwe validate port bind` command has been added to validate if a Zowe component is likely to succeed at binding to a TCP socket, and is used at startup to reduce likelihood of misconfiguration.([#4447](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4447))
* Enhanced z/OSMF's registration to API ML single-service deployment to respect the authentication method specified in API ML single-service deployment configuration. In prior releases, access to z/OSMF would always use z/OSMF’s own authentication, such as LTPA or JWT, but now, if API ML single-service deployment is configured to use SAF directly instead of using z/OSMF as an authentication provider, then z/OSMF access will use passtickets. ([#4563](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4563))
* Improved the Zowe installation process by enabling the API ML single-service deployment mode by default. ([#4565](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4565))
* Enhanced `zwe` to detect whether the System Display and Search Facility (SDSF) is available on the z/OS system. ([#4389](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4389))
* Enhanced the `ZWEGEN00` application which allows to add a backslash (`\`) character to the end of paths to extend them to the next line. This allows you to use longer paths within the `ZWEGENER` job. ([#4459](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4459))
* Removed the NodeJS dependency for all zwe commands. NodeJS is still required for running the app-server, but this change would allow you to run Zowe without NodeJS if you were for example only using APIML or ZSS. ([#4307](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4307))

### Zowe Application Framework

#### Zlux Server Framework
* Enhanced app-server to work with IPv6 addresses. This allows you to specify IPv6 addresses to the app-server in parameters which previously only allowed IPv4 and hostname values. ([#614](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/614))
* Eureka registration to discovery server now handles IPv6 in URLs. ([#614](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/614))

#### Zlux App Manager
* Added Zowe YAML parameter `components.app-server.enablePasswordChange` which has a default value of `true`. When set to `false`, you can disable the `Change Password` UI of the Zowe Desktop to fit your organization’s preference. ([#672](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-manager/pull/672))

#### Zlux App-Server 
* Built-in apps in Zowe such as `zlux-editor`, `tn3270-ng2`, `vt-ng2` can now be enabled or disabled with the same syntax that you use for `explorer-jes` using settings in the `zowe.yaml` configuration file. ([#346](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/346))
* Fixed the App-Server so that it stopped printing the contents of the `zowe.sysMessages` file. The contents are prevented from being unnecessarily captured by the system log messaging system used by the Zowe Launcher. ([#352](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/352))  
* Added new flag in `zowe.yaml` `enablePasswordChange` which controls the access to _Change Password_ tool in _Personalization Panel_. ([#347](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/347))

### Zowe Common C
* Enhanced Zowe’s networking functions, such as `tcpServer`, `tcpClient`, `httpServer`, and `httpClient` to now support, recognize, and use IPv6 addresses. ([#554](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/554), [#539](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/539))

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

* OpenTelemetry has now been enabled for single-service deployment (modulith) of API Mediation Layer. ([#4380](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4380))
* Keyrings with HW based ICSF keys are now supported. ([#4354](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4354))
* SAF is now set as the default authentication provider. ([#4374](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4374))
* API ML now supports multiple OIDC providers at the same time. ([#4295](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4295))
* API ML now supports mapping custom claims from OIDC token to mainframe identity. ([#4300](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/pull/4300))

## Bug fixes

Zowe Version 3.4.0 contains the bug fixes that are described in the following topics:

### Server Install

* Improved the startup process of Zowe by removing the outdated static definition files from the `workspace/api-mediation/api-defs` directory. ([#4526](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4526))
* Fixed an issue where the `--update-config`  command failed after you ran the command and specified a configuration file, which was a symbolic link (a shortcut to another file). ([#4492](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4492))
* The Zowe PSWI installation now creates `zowe.yaml` in the `zowe.workspaceDirectory` rather than `zowe.runtimeDirectory`. ([#4397](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4397))
* Zowe startup now removes outdated static definition files from `zowe.workspaceDirectory/api-mediation/api-defs`, which previously caused wrong or duplicate registrations of servers to APIML. ([#4526](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4526))


### Zowe Application Framework

#### Zlux Server Framework
* Fixed an issue where TN3270 and VT terminals of the Zowe Desktop would have blank screens when using AT-TLS. ([#617](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/617))

#### Zlux App-Server
* App-server no longer prints out the contents of `zowe.sysMessages`, so that it will not get captured by the SYSLOG messaging system of the launcher. ([#352](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/352))


### Zowe API Mediation Layer
