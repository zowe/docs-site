## New features and enhancements

Zowe Version 3.4.0 contains the enhancements that are described in the following topics:

### Server Install

* Enhanced z/OSMF registration to APIML to respect the authentication method specified in APIML configuration. In prior releases, access to z/OSMF would always use z/OSMF’s own authentication, such as LTPA or JWT, but now if APIML is configured to use SAF directly instead of using z/OSMF as an authentication provider, then z/OSMF access will use passtickets. ([#4563](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4563))
* Improved the Zowe installation process by enabling the API ML modulith mode by default. ([#4565](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4565))
* Enhanced `zwe` to detect whether the System Display and Search Facility (SDSF) is available on the z/OS system. ([#4389](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4389))
* Enhanced the `ZWEGEN00` job where you can now add a backslash (\) character to the end of paths to extend them to the next line. This allows you to use longer paths within the job. ([#4459](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4459))
* Removed the NodeJS dependency for all zwe commands. NodeJS is still required for running the app-server, but this change would allow you to run Zowe without NodeJS if you were for example only using APIML or ZSS. ([#4393](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4393))

### Zowe Application Framework

#### Zlux Server Framework
* Enhanced app-server to work with IPv6 addresses. This allows you to specify IPv6 addresses to the app-server in parameters which previously only allowed IPv4 and hostname values. ([#614](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/614))
* Eureka registration to discovery server now handles IPv6 in URLs. ([#614](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/614))

#### Zlux App Manager
* Added Zowe YAML parameter `components.app-server.enablePasswordChange` which has a default value of `true`. When set to `false`, you can disable the `Change Password` UI of the Zowe Desktop to fit your organization’s preference. ([#672](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-manager/pull/672))

#### Zlux App-Server 
* Built-in apps in Zowe such as `zlux-editor`, `tn3270-ng2`, `vt-ng2` can now be enabled or disabled with the same syntax that you use for `explorer-jes` using settings in the `zowe.yaml` configuration file. ([#346](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/346))
* Fixed the App-Server so that it stopped printing the contents of the `zowe.sysMessages` file. The contents are prevented from being unnecessarily captured by the system log messaging system used by the Zowe Launcher. ([#352](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/352))  
* Added new flag in `zowe.yaml` `enablePasswordChange` which controls the access to _Change Password_ tool in _Personalization Panel_. ([#347](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/347))

### Zowe Common C
* Enhanced Zowe’s networking functions, such as `tcpServer`, `tcpClient`, `httpServer`, and `httpClient` to now support, recognize, and use IPv6 addresses. ([#554](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/554), [#539](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/539))

### ZSS

### Basic TN3270 Display Emulator


### Zowe API Mediation Layer

* opentelemetry has now been enabled for single-service deployment (modulith) of API Mediation Layer. ([#4380](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4380))
* Keyrings with ICSF keys are now supported. ([#4354](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4354))
* Updated the z/OSMF template to use the SAF provider as the default. ([#4374](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4374))
* API ML now supports multiple OIDC providers at the same time. ([#4295](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4295))

## Bug fixes

Zowe Version 3.4.0 contains the bug fixes that are described in the following topics:

### Server Install

* Fixed the issue within internal routine copy_to_data_set in which zwe commands would report that the destination of the copy operation already existed, even if it did not. ([#4476](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4476))
* Improved the startup process of Zowe by removing the outdated static definition files from the `workspace/api-mediation/api-defs` directory. ([#4526](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4526))
* Fixed an issue where the `--update-config`  command failed after you ran the command and specified a configuration file, which was a symbolic link (a shortcut to another file). ([#4492](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4492))
* The Zowe PSWI installation now creates `zowe.yaml` in the `zowe.workspaceDirectory` rather than `zowe.runtimeDirectory`. ([#4397](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4397))
* Zowe startup now removes outdated static definition files from `zowe.workspaceDirectory/api-mediation/api-defs`, which previously caused wrong or duplicate registrations of servers to APIML. ([#4526](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4526))
* `--update-config` might fail if the specified config file is a symbolic link. ([#4492](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4492))

### Zowe Application Framework

#### Zlux Server Framework
* Fixed an issue where TN3270 and VT terminals of the Zowe Desktop would have blank screens when using AT-TLS. ([#617](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/617))

#### Zlux App-Server
* App-server no longer prints out the contents of `zowe.sysMessages`, so that it will not get captured by the SYSLOG messaging system of the launcher. ([#352](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/352))

### Zowe Common C

### ZSS
* Fixed an issue in the bind-test program where the program did not correctly lookup a hostname into an IP address. ([#801](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/801))


### Zowe API Mediation Layer

* Added service ID validation. ([#4375](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4375))
* Fixed certificate chain parsing with Java JCA Hybrid provider. ([#4376](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4376))
* Closed expired connections. ([#4383](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4383))
* Corrected description in API doc ([#4348](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4348))
* Fixed environment variable in start.sh for ICSF. ([#4369](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4369))
* Fixed shell script. ([#4357](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4357) and [#4382](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4382))
* Fixed Spel expression in case of non-defined variable. ([#4361](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4361))
* Fixed Integration tests to run with SAF auth provider. ([#4386](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4386))
* Resolved conflicting beans. ([#4387](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4387))
* Fixed URLs for onboarding when AT-TLS is enabled. ([#4169](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4169))
