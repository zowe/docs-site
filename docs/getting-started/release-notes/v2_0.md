## Breaking changes

### Zowe installation

* You must pass `-ppx` when you unpax the Zowe convenience build to preserve extended file attributes.
* All utility scripts, like `zowe-install.sh`, `zowe-install-xmem.sh`, `zowe-install-proc.sh`, `validate-directory-is-accessible.sh`, and so on, are removed and migrated to the new `zwe` server command format.
* If you rely on some of the scripts, please find the alternative new `zwe` command or shell library functions.
* `ZWESVSTC` is removed and `ZWESLSTC` will replace it to start Zowe.
* `instance.env` is deprecated and replaced by `zowe.yml`.
* In V2, you use the `P` command to terminate Zowe instead of the `C` cancel command.
* Zowe now allows fine-grained customization of log, workspace, and configuration directories. By default, these directories remain grouped under an `instance` directory (same as Zowe v1).
* Environment variables are reorganized to better describe itself. All `zowe.yaml` configuration entries will be automatically converted to environment variables for easy consumption. Check with the community what the new alternative variable names are.
* During Zowe configuration, redundant `ip` fields will be removed or consolidated in favor of `hostname` or `domains`.
* Component or extension manifest is mandatory. You must use the `zwe components install` command to install the extension.

### API Mediation Layer
  
* Removed the support for the old path pattern ([#1770](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1770)). This includes the changes to the endpoints used in ZAAS client. If your application uses ZAAS client, please verify whether the configuration properties use the new path pattern (`/gateway/api/v1` instead of `/api/v1/gateway`).
* Removed the support for different authentication schemas for different instances of service ([#1051](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1051)).

### Zowe Application Framework

Some configuration, such as port and IP values, are different by default in V2  but can be reconfigured to old values. However, some application framework extensions may not work in V2 without enhancements.

* Consolidation of Web Explorer Servers: Bookmarks to USS, MVS, JES explorers will be broken due to URL change.
* `loopback routing` disabled: Loopback routing alternative may not be 100% compatible. It can be disabled via config parameter `node.internalRouting=false`.
* `server.json` removed: The mandatory `zowe.yaml` can contain the same content as `server.json` within the objects `components.app-server` and `components.zss`.
* Scripts that wrote to `server.json` will be broken. You must adapt them to write to `zowe.yaml` instead.
* Incompatible desktop library version upgrades: Angular 12, corejs, and typescript were updated in the Zowe Desktop, and non-iframe plugins that depend on them may break.
* ZSS cookie name change: ZSS cookie name now includes a suffix of either port name or HA/FT ID to distinguish between unrelated ZSS servers.
* Internationalization that use Angular has changed from 6 (`TranslationService`  for example) to 12 (`L10TranslationService` for example). For help in updating your Zowe Desktop applications to match new internationalization usage, you can see [Sample Angular App example](https://github.com/zowe/sample-angular-app/pull/69/files).

### Zowe CLI

* Breaking changes for Zowe CLI end users:

    * `zowe config` no longer manages app settings (Imperative and CLI)
    * `fail-on-error` default changed to true for `zowe plugins validate` (Imperative and CLI)
    * Default Imperative and CLI log level changed from DEBUG to WARN (Imperative and CLI), which potentially changes troubleshooting steps for providing information to support.

* Breaking changes that could prevent a V1 plug-in or SDK from working in V2

    * CLI package should be removed as a plug-in peer dep (Imperative)
    * `AbstractRestClient.mDecode` defaults to true so any plugin with custom RestClient implementation that adds gzip decompression may break
    * The return value for `PluginManagementFacility.requirePluginModuleCallback` changed. Application and plugin developers requiring a module from a plug-in's relative path using the `requirePluginModuleCallback` function no longer need to provide the plug-in name in a separate variable `this.pluginNmForUseInCallback = pluginName` before binding the class `this.requirePluginModuleCallback.bind(this)`. Instead they can call `this.requirePluginModuleCallback(pluginName)`.
       * Previously in V1:
        ```
        this.pluginNmForUseInCallback = pluginName
        ConfigurationLoader.load(null,pkgJsonData,this.requirePluginModuleCallback.bind(this))
        ```
       * In V2:
        ```
        pluginConfig = ConfigurationLoader.load(null,pkgJsonData,this.requirePluginModuleCallback(pluginName))
        ```
* Breaking changes for Zowe CLI and Imperative plug-in developers
   
    These changes only impact early adopters of @next as these are breaking changes made during the technical preview validation phase. Thanks to the community for the feedback.

    * `tokenType` and `tokenValue` were combined into `authToken`, which later was reverted (Imperative and CLI) 
    * Options in `zowe config` group are renamed: `--user` is renamed to `--user-config`, and `--global` to `--global-config`.
    * `Zowe.schema.json` format changed a few times (version 2, version 3): `ConfigSchemas.loadProfileSchemas` is changed to `ConfigSchemas.loadSchema`
    * `Config.set` no longer coerces string values to other types unless `parseString = true` which might impact the SDK instead of CLI plug-ins.


## New features and enhancements

### Zowe installation

* Introduced a new server command `zwe` to balance between simplification and flexibility on installation and configuration.
   * Almost all Zowe utility scripts in V1 are consolidated into new `zwe` server command. This new command defines consistent help messages, logging options, and so on. See the [ZWE Command Reference](../appendix/zwe_server_command_reference) for more information.
   * Provides shell function library to help extensions to achieve common tasks. For example, execute TSO command, operator command, submit job and check job completion, and so on.
   * Keep away from commands/functions marked as experimental and internal.
* Installation / Configuration changes
   * During installation, no new runtime directory will be created.
   * A `zowe.yaml` file can be used to centralize all configuration options. This configuration is compatible with all Zowe use cases (including high availability and containerization).
   * For almost all Zowe configuration steps, an automation option `zwe init` command is provided. You can still choose to run all steps one by one.
   * Provides the `--security-dry-run` mode that allows you to generate security commands and pass along to your system admin.
   * You can run all steps from USS now.
* A Zowe component or extension can use `manifest.yaml` to define how it interacts with Zowe and other components.
   * The component or extension must define a `manifest.yaml` or `manifest.json` file to describe itself. The manifest allows you to define how to register on Zowe API ML Discovery, how to register under Zowe Desktop, and whether itâ€™s Java extension library for API ML, and so on.
   * Components can define their own `configs` in `manifest.yaml` which shows you how to customize this component and provides default values if they are not defined. This option is compatible with Zowe running in high availability mode.
* Introduced new data sets to better organize the contents.
   * Added `SZWEEXEC` to contain few utility tools.
   * You can customize your own PARMLIB, APF Authorized LOADLIB and APF-authorized ZIS plug-ins library. `CUST.JCLIB` is a data set where Zowe will store temporary JCLs.
* Use PARMLIB to configure Zowe.
  
  With traditional PARMLIB concatenation, system programmers can plan their Zowe rollout more like other z/OS products. Multiple YAML configurations will be concatenated and merged. JSON Schema is introduced to help on validating user customized configurations.

### Zowe Application Framework

Zowe V2 simplifies the installation and configuration. Reduced overhead and increased performance due to reduction in server count. Optimized networking and 64 bit ZSS.

* Consolidation of Web Explorer Servers: Explorer USS, MVS, and JES no longer have node servers (3 less servers), due to utilizing app-server for hosting. Consolidation of web explorer servers
* Jobs and Datasets APIs now disabled by default (2 less servers), and Explorers do not rely on them
* Replaced referrer security check with 'samesite' cookie option: No longer need to specify external hostname to pass security check
* Removed "loopback routing" in app-server: Resolves bugs around use of a loopback IP when running app-server
* Support specifying advanced app-server and zss config in `zowe.yaml`: Simplify/Unify app framework configuration by using 1 config file rather than 2 (`instance.env`, `server.json`)
* Contiguous default ports: App framework ports (formerly 85xx) now follow API ML ports (75xx)
* App-server bind to IP_ADDRESS by default: Instead of  `0.0.0.0`, app-server now uses same IP as rest of Zowe servers
* Consistent environment variable names: Standardize environment variable names around `ZWED_`, and `ZWES_` prefixes for consistency. Aliases to previous names
* Informative desktop login messages: Desktop login failures now print useful troubleshooting details about server communication issues
* ZSS 64 bit: ZSS 64 bit version now exists alongside prior 31-bit version. Better performance and higher memory limit. Now utilizes 64-bit cross-memory to ZIS
* New desktop library versions: Angular 6->12, Corejs 2->3, Typescript 2->4
