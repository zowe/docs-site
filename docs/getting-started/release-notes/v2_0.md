## Breaking changes

### Zowe installation

* You must pass `-ppx` when you unpax the Zowe convenience build to preserve extended file attributes.
* All utility scripts, like `zowe-install.sh`, `zowe-install-xmem.sh`, `zowe-install-proc.sh`, `validate-directory-is-accessible.sh`, are removed and migrated to the new `zwe` server command format.
* If you rely on some of the scripts, find the alternative new `zwe` command or shell library functions.
* `ZWESVSTC` is removed and `ZWESLSTC` will replace it to start Zowe.
* `instance.env` is deprecated and replaced by `zowe.yml`.
* In V2, you use the `P` command to terminate Zowe instead of the `C` cancel command.
* Zowe now allows fine-grained customization of log, workspace, and configuration directories. By default, these directories remain grouped under an `instance` directory (same as Zowe v1).
* Environment variables are reorganized to better describe itself. All `zowe.yaml` configuration entries will be automatically converted to environment variables for easy consumption. Check with the community what the new alternative variable names are.
* During Zowe configuration, redundant `ip` fields will be removed or consolidated in favor of `hostname` or `domains`.
* Component or extension manifest is mandatory. You must use the `zwe components install` command to install the extension.

### API Mediation Layer
  
* Removed the support for the old path pattern ([#1770](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1770)). This includes the changes to the endpoints used in ZAAS client. If your application uses ZAAS client, please verify whether the configuration properties use the new path pattern (`/gateway/api/v1` instead of `/api/v1/gateway`).
* Removed the support for different authentication schemas for different instances of service ([#1051](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1051)).

### Zowe Application Framework

Some configuration, such as port and IP values, are different by default in V2 but can be reconfigured to old values. However, some application framework extensions may not work in V2 without enhancements.

* zLUX App Manager

   Due to new library versions, native apps such as Angular and React apps written for Zowe v1 may not work in Zowe v2. Rebuilding the apps with the same versions and the latest webpack build scripts is recommended.

* zLUX Server Framework

   * The list of properties sent back from the /server/environment has changed to reflect the different environment values present in Zowe v2
   * Adjusted the server to respect ZSS's new cookie format in which the port or HA instance ID is a suffix of the ZSS cookie. This means that the server may not work properly when paired with a v1 ZSS and works best with v2 ZSS.

* zLUX Editor

   The app now uses angular 12, making it compatible with Zowe v2 desktop and incompatible with v1 desktop.

* Basic VT Terminal Emulator

   Upgrade to Angular 12, Typescript 4, and Corejs 3 to match Desktop libraries in Zowe v2. This app may no longer work in the Zowe v1 Desktop, and v2 should be used instead.

* Basic TN3270 Display Emulator

   Upgrade to Angular 12, Typescript 4, and Corejs 3 to match Desktop libraries in Zowe v2. This app may no longer work in the Zowe v1 Desktop, and v2 should be used instead.

* Sample angular app

   The app now uses angular 12, making it compatible with Zowe v2 desktop and incompatible with v1 desktop.


### Zowe CLI

* Breaking changes for Zowe CLI end users:

    * `zowe config` no longer manages app settings (Imperative and CLI)
    * `fail-on-error` default changed to true for `zowe plugins validate` (Imperative and CLI)
    * Default Imperative and CLI log level changed from DEBUG to WARN (Imperative and CLI), which potentially changes troubleshooting steps for providing information to support.

* Breaking changes that could prevent a V1 plug-in or SDK from working in V2

    * CLI package should be removed as a plug-in peer dep (Imperative)
    * `AbstractRestClient.mDecode` defaults to true so any plugin with custom RestClient implementation that adds gzip decompression may break
    * The return value for `PluginManagementFacility.requirePluginModuleCallback` changed. Application and plugin developers requiring a module from a plug-in's relative path using the `requirePluginModuleCallback` function no longer need to provide the plug-in name in a separate variable `this.pluginNmForUseInCallback = pluginName` before binding the class `this.requirePluginModuleCallback.bind(this)`. Instead they can call `this.requirePluginModuleCallback(pluginName)`.
       * Previously in V1:
        ```
        this.pluginNmForUseInCallback = pluginName
        ConfigurationLoader.load(null,pkgJsonData,this.requirePluginModuleCallback.bind(this))
        ```
       * In V2:
        ```
        pluginConfig = ConfigurationLoader.load(null,pkgJsonData,this.requirePluginModuleCallback(pluginName))
        ```
* Breaking changes for Zowe CLI and Imperative plug-in developers
   
    These changes only impact early adopters of @next as these are breaking changes made during the technical preview validation phase. Thanks to the community for the feedback.

    * `tokenType` and `tokenValue` were combined into `authToken`, which later was reverted (Imperative and CLI) 
    * Options in `zowe config` group are renamed: `--user` is renamed to `--user-config`, and `--global` to `--global-config`.
    * `Zowe.schema.json` format changed a few times (version 2, version 3): `ConfigSchemas.loadProfileSchemas` is changed to `ConfigSchemas.loadSchema`
    * `Config.set` no longer coerces string values to other types unless `parseString = true` which might impact the SDK instead of CLI plug-ins.


## New features and enhancements

### Zowe installation

* Introduced a new server command `zwe` to balance between simplification and flexibility on installation and configuration.
   * Almost all Zowe utility scripts in V1 are consolidated into new `zwe` server command. This new command defines consistent help messages, logging options, and so on. See the [ZWE Command Reference](../appendix/zwe_server_command_reference) for more information.
   * Provides shell function library to help extensions to achieve common tasks. For example, execute TSO command, operator command, submit job and check job completion, and so on.
   * Keep away from commands/functions marked as experimental and internal.
* Installation / Configuration changes
   * During installation, no new runtime directory will be created.
   * A `zowe.yaml` file can be used to centralize all configuration options. This configuration is compatible with all Zowe use cases (including high availability and containerization).
   * For almost all Zowe configuration steps, an automation option `zwe init` command is provided. You can still choose to run all steps one by one.
   * Provides the `--security-dry-run` mode that allows you to generate security commands and pass along to your system admin.
   * You can run all steps from USS now.
* A Zowe component or extension can use `manifest.yaml` to define how it interacts with Zowe and other components.
   * The component or extension must define a `manifest.yaml` or `manifest.json` file to describe itself. The manifest allows you to define how to register on Zowe API ML Discovery, how to register under Zowe Desktop, and whether it’s Java extension library for API ML, and so on.
   * Components can define their own `configs` in `manifest.yaml` which shows you how to customize this component and provides default values if they are not defined. This option is compatible with Zowe running in high availability mode.
* Introduced new data sets to better organize the contents.
   * Added `SZWEEXEC` to contain few utility tools.
   * You can customize your own PARMLIB, APF Authorized LOADLIB and APF-authorized ZIS plug-ins library. `CUST.JCLIB` is a data set where Zowe will store temporary JCLs.
* Use PARMLIB to configure Zowe.
  
  With traditional PARMLIB concatenation, system programmers can plan their Zowe rollout more like other z/OS products. Multiple YAML configurations will be concatenated and merged. JSON Schema is introduced to help on validating user customized configurations.
