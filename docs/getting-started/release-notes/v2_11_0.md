## Bug fixes

Zowe Version 2.11.0 contains the bug fixes that are described in the following topics.

### Zowe installation and packaging

### Zowe Application Framework

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

### Zowe CLI

#### Zowe CLI (Core)

- Fixed an issue in the Daemon server which prevents users on Windows with uppercase letters in their username from using the Daemon. ([#1765](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/1765))
- Added a check to the `zowe files create data-set` command to prevent users from specifying an invalid block size for sequential data sets with variable block format. ([#1439](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1439))
- Fixed a failure with the `zowe auth logout apiml` command that occurred if the user had an invalid or expired token. A user with an invalid or expired token can use the `zowe auth logout apiml` command to remove the expired token from their secure credential storage. ([#1734](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/1734))
- Removed the need to check for basepath when the user was logging out to prevent misleading `basePath error` when credentials are invalid. ([#1734](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/1734))

#### Zowe CLI Imperative Framework

- Fixed merging of profile properties in `ProfileInfo.createSession`. ([#1008](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/1008))
- Fixed an issue to now allow a user to run the `zowe auth logout apiml` command multiple times without failing. ([#966](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/pull/996))
- Updated the `auto-init` command to prevent an unwanted second login request if the user already has a token. ([#966](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/pull/996))
