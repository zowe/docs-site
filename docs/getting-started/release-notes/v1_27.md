## New features and enhancements

### Zowe installation and packaging

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

### Zowe Application Framework

* The app framework and the rest of Zowe no longer requires a PKCS#11 ISCF setup. Previously, PKCS#11 was used for single sign on (SSO) by ZSS, but ZSS now automatically  completes SSO setup at start-up of Zowe through negotiation with the API Mediation Layer Gateway. As a result, SSO is now automatic and enabled by default when the API mediation layer, ZSS, and optionally the app server is enabled. This enhancement will work with existing PKCS#11 setups, but they are no longer used.
* The app framework and the rest of Zowe no longer requires a "jwtsecret" object in the Zowe keystore. Previously, this was used for single sign on (SSO) but SSO has been simplified, and now only HTTPS keys and certificates are needed within the keystore. This enhancement will work with existing keystores but the jwtsecret object is no longer used.
