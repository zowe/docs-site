## New features and enhancements

Zowe Version 2.12.0 contains the enhancements that are described in the following topics.

### Zowe Application Framework 

#### Zlux App Server

- New versions of the components can change the location of their plugins, as the app-server will now re-inspect the plugin locations on each startup. ([#280](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/280))

#### ZLUX Server Framework

- Auth plug-ins that are not requested by any dataservice found at startup are no longer loaded by the server. ([#504](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/504))

#### ZSS

- ZSS now defaults to using `TLS 1.3`, which requires a minimum of zOS Version `2.4`. ([#646] (https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/646))
- Added configuration parameter `components.zss.agent.https.maxTls` to control which level of TLS to use, allowing downgrading to `tls 1.2` if desired with value `TLSv1.2`. ([#654]( https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/654))
- Added configuration parameter `components.zss.agent.https.trace` which can be set to `true` if desired to capture a `GSK` trace, which will be put into the log directory. ([#654]( https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/654))
