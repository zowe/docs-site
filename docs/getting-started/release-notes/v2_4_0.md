### Zowe installation and packaging

- Updated ZWEWRF03 workflow to be up to date with the installed software.

### Zowe Application Framework

#### ZSS

- ZSS /datasetContents now has a PUT API for creating datasets.
- ZIS dynamic linkage support

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

- Validate OIDC token ([#2604](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2604)) ([cdd4a43](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/commit/cdd4a43))
- Introduced service routing based on header to enables the Cloud Gateway to route to a southbound service by information in the request header. ([#2600](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2600)) ([6fafb60](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/commit/6fafb60))
- Introduced a new cloud gateway service that  provides routing functionality for multi-sysplex environments. ([#2576](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2576)) ([7c618c0](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/commit/7c618c0))

### Zowe CLI

#### Zowe CLI (Core)

- Added the `zowe files download uss-dir` command to download the contents of a USS directory. ([#1038](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1038))
- Updated the `zowe files upload file-to-uss` and `zowe files upload dir-to-uss` commands to improve how they handle file encoding. ([#1479](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1479))
    - Both commands now "chtag" files after uploading them to indicate their remote encoding. This matches the already existing behavior of the `zowe files download uss-file` command which checks file tags before downloading.
    - The behavior of `.zosattributes` files which can specify local and remote encoding has been changed. Files are now converted to remote encoding, not just tagged. If no encoding is specified, the default transfer mode is *text* instead of *binary* to be consistent with z/OSMF default behavior.

#### z/OS FTP Plug-in for Zowe CLI

- Added a new profile property to support encoding for data sets. ([#120](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-ftp-plugin/pull/120))
- Added the ability to filter jobs based on status (e.g., Active, Held, Output, Input). ([#119](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-ftp-plugin/pull/119))

### Zowe Explorer

- Added check for existing team configuration file in location during create, prompting user to continue with the create action. ([#1923](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/issues/1923))
- Added a solution to allow Zowe Explorer extensions with a dependency on Zowe Explorer to work as web extension without Zowe Explorer functionality in `vscode.dev`. ([#1953](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/pull/1953))

### Zowe Explorer FTP Extension

- Added support for profile file encoding used for upload and download of MVS files. ([#1942](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/pull/1942))
