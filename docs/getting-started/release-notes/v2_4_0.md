## New features and enhancements

Zowe Version 2.4.0 contains the enhancements that are described in the following topics.

### Zowe installation and packaging



### Zowe Application Framework

#### Zowe App Server 



#### Zowe Common C



#### ZSS



### Zowe API Mediation Layer



### Zowe CLI

#### Zowe CLI (Core)

- Added the `zowe files download uss-dir` command to download the contents of a USS directory. ([#1038](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1038))
- Updated the `zowe files upload file-to-uss` and `zowe files upload dir-to-uss` commands to improve how they handle file encoding. ([#1479](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1479))
    - Both commands now "chtag" files after uploading them to indicate their remote encoding. This matches the already existing behavior of the `zowe files download uss-file` command which checks file tags before downloading.
    - The behavior of `.zosattributes` files which can specify local and remote encoding has been changed. Files are now converted to remote encoding, not just tagged. If no encoding is specified, the default transfer mode is *text* instead of *binary* to be consistent with z/OSMF default behavior.

#### z/OS FTP Plug-in for Zowe CLI

- Added a new profile property to support encoding for data sets. ([#120](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-ftp-plugin/pull/120))
- Added the ability to filter jobs based on status (e.g., Active, Held, Output, Input). ([#119](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-ftp-plugin/pull/119))

### Zowe Explorer

- Added check for existing team configuration file in location during create, prompting user to continue with the create action. ([#1923](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/issues/1923))
- Added a solution to allow Zowe Explorer extensions with a dependency on Zowe Explorer to work as web extension without Zowe Explorer functionality in `vscode.dev`. ([#1953](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/pull/1953))

### Zowe Explorer FTP Extension

- Added support for profile file encoding used for upload and download of MVS files. ([#1942](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/pull/1942))

#### Extensibility API for Zowe Explorer
