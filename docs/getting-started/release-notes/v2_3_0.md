#### Zowe CLI (Core)

#### Zowe CLI Imperative Framework



- Prevented base profile secure-property lookup on the global layer when there is not default base profile. ([#881](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/881))
- Fixed exception when non-string passed to ImperativeExpect.toBeDefinedAndNonBlank(). ([#856](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/856))
- Removed periods in command example descriptions so descriptions look syntactically correct. ([#795](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/795))
- Improved performance of ProfileInfo API to load large team config files. zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe#1911
- Fixed dot-separated words incorrectly rendered as links in the web help. ([#869](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/869))
- Web-diff template directory included in files section of package.json file.
- Changed the default log level of `Console` class from "debug" to "warn" so it is consistent with `Logger` class behavior. In Zowe v2.0 the `Logger` class was changed to have a default log level of "warn" but the `Console` class was not changed. To modify a log level, you can change it after initializing the console like this: `console.level = "info";` zowe/zowe-cli#511
- Introduced examples for setting default profiles in `zowe config set` Examples section. ([#1428](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1428))
