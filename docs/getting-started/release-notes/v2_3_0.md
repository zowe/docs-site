Zowe CLI and related components contain the following bug fixes:

- Updated Imperative to include bug fixes in version 5.5.1.

- Fixed output of `download data-sets-matching` being printed twice when some data sets fail to download.
- Altered the `zowe daemon disable` command to kill only the daemon running for the current user.

#### Zowe CLI (Core)

To modify a log level, you can change it after initializing the console like this: `console.level = "info";` ([Zowe CLI #511](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/511))
