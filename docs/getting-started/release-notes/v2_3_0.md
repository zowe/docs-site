### Zowe CLI

Zowe CLI and related components contain the following bug fixes:

- Updated Imperative to include bug fixes in version 5.5.1.
- Renamed `download data-set-matching` to `download data-sets-matching`. The old name still exists as an alias.
- Fixed output of `download data-sets-matching` being printed twice when some data sets fail to download.
- Altered the `zowe daemon disable` command to kill only the daemon running for the current user.

#### Zowe CLI (Core)

#### Zowe CLI Imperative Framework

- Prevented base profile secure-property lookup on the global layer when there is not default base profile. ([#881](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/881))
- Fixed exception when non-string passed to `ImperativeExpect.toBeDefinedAndNonBlank()`. ([#856](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/856))
- Removed periods in command example descriptions so descriptions look syntactically correct. ([#795](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/795))
- Improved performance of ProfileInfo API to load large team config files. ([Zowe Explorer #1911](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/issues/1911))
- Fixed dot-separated words incorrectly rendered as links in the web help. ([#869](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/869))
- Web-diff template directory included in files section of package.json file.
- Changed the default log level of `Console` class from "debug" to "warn" so it is consistent with `Logger` class behavior. In Zowe v2.0 the `Logger` class was changed to have a default log level of "warn" but the `Console` class was not changed. To modify a log level, you can change it after initializing the console like this: `console.level = "info";` ([Zowe CLI #511](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/511))
- Introduced examples for setting default profiles in `zowe config set` Examples section. ([Zowe CLI #1428](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1428))
- Fixed error when installing plug-ins that do not define profiles. ([#859](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/859))
- Removed some extraneous dependencies. ([#477](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/477))

#### Db2 Plug-in for Zowe CLI
- Updated ibm_db dependency to be compatible with Node.js 18.
