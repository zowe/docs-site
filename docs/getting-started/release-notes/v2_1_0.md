#### Zowe CLI Imperative Framework

- Fixed ProfileInfo API `argTeamConfigLoc` not recognizing secure fields in multi-layer operations. ([#800](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/pull/800))
- Fixed ProfileInfo API `updateKnownProperty` possibly storing information in the wrong location due to optional osLoc information. ([#800](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/pull/800))
- Fixed `osLoc` information returning project level paths instead of the global layer. ([#805](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/805))

- Fixed the `plugins uninstall` command failing when there is a space in the install path.
- Fixed an issue where `config auto-init` might fail to create project config when global config already exists. ([#810](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/810))
- Fixed `config secure` not respecting the `rejectUnauthorized` property in team config. ([#813](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/813))
- Fixed `config import` not respecting the `rejectUnauthorized` property in team config. ([#816](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/816))

- Fixed `config init` saving empty string values to config file when prompt was skipped.
- Fixed `ConfigLayers.read` skipping load of secure property values.
- Improved the performance of `ConfigLayers.activate` by skipping config reload if the active layer directory has not changed.
- Removed the `async` keyword from the `ConfigLayers.read` mathod and the `ConfigLayers.write` method because they do not contain asynchronous code.
- Fixed `ProfileInfo.readProfilesFromDisk` failing when team config files and old-school profile directory do not exist.
- Fixed `ProfileInfo.updateProperty` not updating properties that are newly present after reloading team config.

    **Note:** If you are developing an SDK that uses the ProfileInfo API, use the method `ProfileInfo.getTeamConfig` instead of `ImperativeConfig.instance.config` which may contain outdated config or be undefined.

- Fixed ProfileInfo API not detecting secure credential manager after profiles have been reloaded.
