## New features and enhancements

Zowe Version 2.9.0 contains the enhancements that are described in the following topics.

### Zowe installation and packaging

### Zowe Application Framework

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

### Imperative CLI Framework

- Added the function `IO.giveAccessOnlyToOwner` to restrict access to only the currently running user ID for security.

- Enabled command arguments to change `{$Prefix}_EDITOR`. Updated `IDiffOptions`
to include names for the files that are to be compared. Updated `IO.getDefaultTextEditor()` for different OS versions. Updated return value types for `CliUtils.readPrompt`. This prepares development of future commands in Zowe CLI. ([#967](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/pull/967))

- Altered `TextUtils` behavior slightly to enable daemon color support without TTY.

### Zowe CLI

- Updated daemon to use `tokio` library instead of the unmaintained `named_pipe` library for technical currency.

- Added the `zowe files copy dsclp` command to copy a data set from one LPAR to another, making data transfer between LPARs easier. ([#1098](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1098))

- Re-enabled color in the daemon client to differentiate text displayed in the terminal. ([#1379](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1379))

### Zowe Explorer

- Added option to save unique data set attributes as a template after allocation for future use. ([#1425](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/issues/1425))

- Added "Cancel Job" feature for job nodes in Jobs panel view. ([#2251](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/issues/2251))

- Enhanced ID generation for parent tree nodes to ensure uniqueness.
## Bug fixes

Zowe Version 2.9.0 contains the bug fixes that are described in the following topics.

### Zowe installation and packaging

### Zowe Application Framework

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

### Imperative CLI Framework

- Updated handle logic to display a warning in cases where a `null` command handler is provided.

- Fixed a logic error in the `config list` command that caused unwanted behavior when a positional argument and the `--locations` option were both passed in the command.

- Reduced file loading time by searching for command definitions with the `fast-glob` NPM module instead of the `glob` module.

- Removed validation of the deprecated `pluginHealthCheck` property because it was an unused feature. ([#980](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/980))

### Zowe CLI

- Enabled ANSI in Windows-based terminals to better display progress bars when using daemon mode. ([#1701](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1701))

- Changed daemon to spawn as its own process to avoid unintentional termination of the daemon mode. ([#1241](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1241), [#1277](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1277), [#1309](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1309))

- Fixed `--secondary` data set allocation option being specified as `1` unit on `BLANK` type data sets with the `zowe files create data-set` command. ([#1595](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1595))

- Fixed `--range` option so it is not ignored on the `zowe files view uss-file` command.

- Fixed `--binary` option ignored by commands that upload and download USS directories when the `.zosattributes` file is used.

- Fixed `--include-hidden` option ignored by the `zowe files upload dir-to-uss` command when it was used without the `--recursive` option.

- Implemented several updates for technical currency. Updated Imperative to allow for special handling of chalk and coloring in daemon client. Updated `imperative` to fix undesired behavior in the `zowe config list` command in certain situations. Updated `tar` dependency.

### IBM Db2 Database Plug-in for Zowe CLI

- Updated `ibm_db` dependency for better support with Node.js 18.

### Zowe Explorer

- Fixed issue where the **Disable Validation for Profile** context menu option did not update to **Enable Validation for Profile** after use. ([#1897](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/issues/1897))
- Removed "/" characters in `path.join()` calls. ([#2172](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/issues/2172))
- Fixed issue where user was not able to view job spool file with the same DD name in different steps because of duplicated local file name. ([#2279](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/issues/2279))
- Fixed issue where user was not able to view job spool file from jobs with duplicated step names because of duplicated local file name. ([#2315](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/issues/2315))
- Fixed issue with Windows path when uploading file to data set. ([#2323](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/issues/2323))
