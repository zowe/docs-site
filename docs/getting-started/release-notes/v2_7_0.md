## New features and enhancements

Zowe Version 2.7.0 contains the enhancements that are described in the following topics.

### Zowe installation and packaging

### Zowe Application Framework

#### Zowe Install Packaging
* The zowe authorized `loadlib` now contains a new ZIS plugin as a member named `ZWESISDL`. This is the ZIS Dynamic Plugin, and exists for use by other plugins that wish to access `zowe-common-c` utilities at runtime without needing to statically link them in the other plugin. This plugin must be referenced in the `ZWESIP00` parmlib member before use. The samplib for `ZWESIP00` now references this `ZWESISDL` member and it is recommended that you update your `ZWESIP00` member using the samplib if you need to use this plugin.

#### ZSS 
* A new ZIS plugin, `ZISDYNAMIC` is available within the LOADLIB as ZWESISDL. This plugin allows for ZIS plugins to access utility functions of the `zowe-common-c` libraries without needing to statically build them into the plugin itself.
* New REST endpoint that maps distributed username to `RACF` user ID.

#### Zlux Editor
* Added the feature to copy the line content and copy URL link to open a file at a specific line

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

### Zowe CLI

#### Zowe CLI (Core)

Added support for a CLI-specific environment variable file for users who are not able to set system environment variables. ([#1484](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1484))

Added support for downloading job spool content in binary and record formats so you have more options in how to view results. ([#1607](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/1607))

#### Zowe CLI Imperative Framework

Added the `~/.<cli_name>.env.json` file to provide environment variables to the Imperative framework during Imperative initialization. This allows sites without environment variable access to specify process specific environment variables. [#943](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/pull/943)

Added `ProfileInfo.removeKnownProperty` to delete profile properties to use as an alternative to the existing `ProfileInfo.updateKnownProperty` to update a property with an undefined value. To do so, allowed type `IProfArgValue` to be of type `undefined` to support removing properties more easily. ([#917](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/917))

### Zowe Explorer

Added Job search label to the Jobs tree to display the current search query. ([#2062](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/pull/2064))

Added feature to copy datasets (partitioned datasets, sequential, members across partitioned datasets) with multi-select capabilities. ([#1150](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/issues/1550))

## Bug fixes

Zowe Version 2.7.0 contains the bug fixes that are described in the following topics.

### Zowe installation and packaging

### Zowe Application Framework

#### Zowe Install Packaging
* When `zwe` components install detects that the given component is already installed, you will get a message to run `zwe` components upgrade.
* Launcher parameters such as `shareAs` could not be customized globally due to `zowe.launcher` schema being wrong with some parameters nested inside another.
* Launcher parameters within an individual component were not documented to exist despite the launcher allowing per-component customization.
* `zwe` detects and warns against `nodejs` lower than version 14 (Due to end of life of v12).
* Tracing and writing to log files would not work for component scripts when `zowe.useConfigmgr=true`.

#### Zlux App Server
* Explicitly prefer `ipv4` dns results to be compatible with `node 18` since it switched to prefer `ipv6` without configuration. This behavior can be cusomized via `components.app-server.dns.lookupOrder='ipv4'` or `ipv6`. It defaults to `ipv4`.

#### ZSS 
* Fixed `/unixfile/metadata` not working when URL encoded spaces were present in file names.

#### Zlux Editor
* Added a few rules for `JCL` syntax highlighter.
* Set `USS` path to correct directory, when opening the directory or file in new browser tab respectively.
* Getting `400 BAD REQUEST` in the browser when opening the file or dataset in a new browser tab.
* When opening `New File`, editor keeps on using the earlier opened file and its model.

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

### Zowe CLI

#### Zowe CLI (Core)

Enabled option to download output from a submitted job with the -d flag. The -e flag now enables changes to file extension as originally intended. ([#729](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/729))

Changed default value for `modify-jobs` option in the Zowe jobs command group to `2.0`. This change results in calls to z/OSMF becoming synchronous, and a successful response from the `modify`, `cancel`, and `delete` commands indicates the requested action was completed successfully. ([#1459](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1459))

Fix in employing `--context-lines` option for all diff/compare commands. Fixed broken `--seqnum` option implementation. ([#1529](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1529))

Updated Imperative to include bug fixes in version 5.8.2.

#### Zowe CLI Imperative Framework

Fixed `--help-examples` option failing on command groups. ([Zowe CLI #1617](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1617))

Fixed npm not found on `zowe plugins install` when using daemon mode in Windows. ([Zowe CLI #1615](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1615))

Fixed web help not showing top-level options like `--version` for the `zowe` command. ([#927](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/927))

Removed `--help-examples` option from CLI help for commands as it only applies to groups. ([#928](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/928))

### Zowe Explorer

Fixed issue where job search queries were not working properly when favorited. ([#2122](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/issues/2122))

Fixed issues where document changes may fail to upload if the environment has a slow filesystem or mainframe connection, or when VS Code exits during an upload operation. ([#1948](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/issues/1948))
