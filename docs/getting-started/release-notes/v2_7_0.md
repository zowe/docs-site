## New features and enhancements

Zowe Version 2.7.0 contains the enhancements that are described in the following topics.

### Zowe installation and packaging

### Zowe Application Framework

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

### Zowe CLI

#### Zowe CLI (Core)

Added support for a CLI-specific environment variable file for users who are not able to set system environment variables. ([#1484](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1484))

Added support for downloading job spool content in binary and record formats so you have more options in how to view results. ([#1607](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/1607))

#### Zowe CLI Imperative Framework

Added the `~/.<cli_name>.env.json` file to provide environment variables to the Imperative framework during Imperative initialization. This allows sites without environment variable access to specify process specific environment variables. [#943](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/pull/943)

Added `ProfileInfo.removeKnownProperty` to delete profile properties to use as an alternative to the existing `ProfileInfo.updateKnownProperty` to update a property with an undefined value. To do so, allowed type `IProfArgValue` to be of type `undefined` to support removing properties more easily. ([#917](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/917))

### Zowe Explorer

Added Job search label to the Jobs tree to display the current search query. ([#2062](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/pull/2064))

Added feature to copy datasets (partitioned datasets, sequential, members across partitioned datasets) with multi-select capabilities. ([#1150](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/issues/1550))

## Bug fixes

Zowe Version 2.7.0 contains the bug fixes that are described in the following topics.

### Zowe installation and packaging

### Zowe Application Framework

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

### Zowe CLI

#### Zowe CLI (Core)

Enabled option to download output from a submitted job with the -d flag. The -e flag now enables changes to file extension as originally intended. ([#729](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/729))

Changed default value for `modify-jobs` option in the Zowe jobs command group to `2.0`. This change results in calls to z/OSMF becoming synchronous, and a successful response from the `modify`, `cancel`, and `delete` commands indicates the requested action was completed successfully. ([#1459](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1459))

Fix in employing `--context-lines` option for all diff/compare commands. Fixed broken `--seqnum` option implementation. ([#1529](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1529))

Updated Imperative to include bug fixes in version 5.8.2.

#### Zowe CLI Imperative Framework

Fixed `--help-examples` option failing on command groups. ([Zowe CLI #1617](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1617))

Fixed npm not found on `zowe plugins install` when using daemon mode in Windows. ([Zowe CLI #1615](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1615))

Fixed web help not showing top-level options like `--version` for the `zowe` command. ([#927](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/927))

Removed `--help-examples` option from CLI help for commands as it only applies to groups. ([#928](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/928))

### Zowe Explorer

Fixed issue where job search queries were not working properly when favorited. ([#2122](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/issues/2122))

Fixed issues where document changes may fail to upload if the environment has a slow filesystem or mainframe connection, or when VS Code exits during an upload operation. ([#1948](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/issues/1948))
