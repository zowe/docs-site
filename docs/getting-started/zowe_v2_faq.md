# FAQ: Zowe V2

## What is the official date of Zowe V2 LTS?

The official date is TBD, the target is April 25, 2022; look for the official announcement at Zowe.org landing page announcement banner. We are sorry for the delay and any inconvenience coming out of it. 

## Where can I find the current (V1) and new (V2) LTS conformancee criteria? 

The Zowe Squads have prepared XLS spreadsheets with conformance criteria for all Zowe extensions including: CLI, APIs, App Framework, and Explorerfor VS Code. The spreadsheets clearly show the prior / V1 criteria alongside the new / V2 criteria. Please be aware, there are additions, deletions, and CHANGES to the criteria. In some cases the change is simply that a BEST PRACTICE has been deemed REQUIRED. Use the light-GREEN highlights to easily identify the changes. See the Changes to the [Conformance Criteria](https://www.zowe.org/vnext#conformance-changes) section at Zowe.org/vNext.
