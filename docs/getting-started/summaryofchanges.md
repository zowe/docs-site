## Version 1.12.0 LTS (May 2020)

### Requires action
- You need to re-run the `zowe-setup-certificates.sh` script during the upgrade process. This requirement is due to the automatic setup of SSO, which requires users to input new values in the `zowe-setup-certificates.env` file. [#1347](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1347) / Doc: [#1162](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/issues/1162)

### New features and enhancements

<!-- If there is a corresponding GitHub issue, please also include the GitHub issue number. See v1.3.0 release notes as an example.-->

The following features and enhancements were added.

#### Zowe installation
- Added a `-l` optional parameter to the `zowe-support.sh` script. This parameter allows you to specify the custom log directory used in install and configuration when collecting support data. [#1322](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1322) / Doc: [#1165](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/issues/1165)
- Added the validate only mode of Zowe. This allows you to check whether all the component validation checks of the Zowe installation pass without starting any of the components. [#1335](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1335) / Doc: [#1181](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/pull/1181)
- Separated ZSS component from the Zowe App Server component. [#1320](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1320)


#### API Mediation Layer

#### Zowe App Server

#### Zowe CLI

The following features and enhancements were added to the **core Zowe CLI**:

- Added the `zowe files hrec ds` command to recall data sets. [#556](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/556)
- Made the `account` option optional in TSO profiles. [#709](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/709)

### Bug fixes

The following bugs were fixed.

#### Zowe installation
-  Minor enhancements to add log directory validation and remove unnecessary log file splitting. [#1334](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1334), [#1300](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/issues/1300)
- When the automatically detected hostname that Zowe is installed on cannot be resolved, use the IP address instead. This covers the scenario when the USS `hostname` command returned a system name that wasn't externally addressable. [#1279](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1279)
- Fixed an issue that could cause an upgraded version of Zowe to try and use an old version of plug-ins, by switching the desktop to use a relative reference to find plugins. [#1326](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1362)

#### Zowe CLI

To leverage the new features and plug-ins available in this version, you must follow the steps in [Migrating to the LTS version](../user-guide/cli-updatingcli.md#migrating-to-long-term-support-lts-version).

The following new CLI plug-ins are added:

  - [IBM® z/OS FTP Plug-in for Zowe CLI](./../user-guide/cli-ftpplugin.md)
  - [IBM® IMS™ Plug-in for Zowe CLI](./../user-guide/cli-imsplugin.md)
  - [IBM® MQ Plug-in for Zowe CLI](./../user-guide/cli-mqplugin.md)
  - [Secure Credential Store for Zowe CLI](./../user-guide/cli-scsplugin.md)

The following new features and enhancements are added in this version:

- **Notable Change:** The `zowe zos-files download ds` and `zowe zos-files download uf` commands no longer put the full content in the response format json (`--rfj`) output. [More information.](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/331)

- **Notable Change:** The `--pass` option is changed to `--password`  for all commands and profiles (zosmf, cics, etc...). The aliases `--pw` and `--pass` still function. To update a profile, issue the `zowe profiles update` command and use the new option name `--password`.

- **Notable Change:** You can enter `PROMPT*` as a value for any CLI option to enable interactive prompting. If you wrote scripts in which any option is defined with the exact value `PROMPT*`, the script will not execute properly in this version. For more information, see [Using the prompt for sensitive options](./../user-guide/cli-usingcli.md#using-the-prompt-for-sensitive-options).

- Zowe CLI was tested and confirmed to run on Unix System Services (USS) on z/OS. For more information, refer to  blog [Installing Node.js on the Mainframe](https://medium.com/@plape/installing-node-js-on-the-mainframe-both-linux-and-z-os-to-run-zowe-cli-19abb6494e41).

    (The IBM Db2 and Secure Credential Store plug-ins for Zowe CLI will *not* run on z/OS due to native code requirements.)

- The `zowe files copy` command was added for copying the contents of a data set or member to another data set or member. [#580](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/580)

- Zowe CLI now exploits Node.js stream APIs for download and upload of spool files, data sets, and USS files. [(#331)](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/331)

- The following new commands were added for interacting with file systems:
    - `zowe zos-files list fs` [#429](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/429)
    - `zowe zos-files mount fs` [#431](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/431)
    - `zowe zos-files unmount fs` [#432](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/432)

- The following new commands were added for creating USS files and directories:
    - `zowe zos-files create file` [#368](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/368)
    - `zowe zos-files create dir` [#368](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/368)

The IBM® CICS® Plug-in is updated with the following functionality:

  - **Notable Change:** The plug-in now uses HTTPS by default when connecting to CMCI. The option `--protocol http` was added to let you override the default as needed. [#77](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-cics-plugin/issues/77)

  -  Define, enable, install, discard, disable, and delete CICS URIMaps. [#53](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-cics-plugin/issues/53) [#49](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-cics-plugin/issues/49) [#48](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-cics-plugin/issues/48) [#51](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-cics-plugin/issues/51) [#50](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-cics-plugin/issues/50) [#52](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-cics-plugin/issues/52)

  - Define and delete CICS web services. [#58](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-cics-plugin/issues/58) [#59](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-cics-plugin/issues/59)

<!--If there is a corresponding GitHub issue, please also include the GitHub issue number. See v1.3.0 release notes as an example.-->

### New features and enhancements

The following features and enhancements were added.

#### Installation of Zowe z/OS components

- The installation now just needs two parameters configured: the USS location of the runtime directory and a data set prefix where a SAMPLIB and LOADLIB will be created.  The runtime directory permissions are set to 755 and when Zowe is run, no data is written to the runtime directory.
- The way to configure Zowe is changed. Previously, you configured Zowe at installation time with the `zowe-install.yaml` file.  This file has been removed and is no longer used in this release.
- A new directory `zowe-instance-dir` has been introduced that contains configuration data used to launch Zowe.  This allows more than one Zowe instance to be started from the same Zowe runtime directory.  A new file `zowe-instance.env` within each `zowe-instance-dir` directory controls which ports are allocated to the Zowe servers as well as location of any dependencies such as Java, z/OSMF or node.  No configuration data is specified at install time.  The data is only read, validated and used at launch time.  The `zowe-instance.env` file contains a parameter value `LAUNCH_COMPONENT_GROUPS` that allows you to control which Zowe subsystems to launch, for example you can run the Zowe desktop and not the API Mediation Layer, or vice-versa; you can run just the API Mediation Layer and not the Zowe desktop.   The `zowe-instance-dir` directory is also where log files are collected.  Static extensions to the API Mediation Layer are recorded in the Zowe instance directory as well as any plug-in extensions to the Zowe desktop.  This allows the runtime directory to be fully replaced during PTF upgrades or moving to later Zowe releases while preserving configuration data and extension definitions that are held in the instance directory.
- A new directory `keystore-directory` has been introduced outside of the Zowe runtime directory which is where the Zowe certificate is held, as well as the truststore for public certificates from z/OS services that Zowe communicates to (such as z/OSMF).  A keystore directory can be shared between multiple Zowe instances and across multiple Zowe runtimes.
- All configuration of z/OS security that was done by Unix shell scripts during installation and configuration has been removed.  A JCL member `ZWESECUR` is provided that contains all of the JCL needed to configure permissions, user IDs and groups, and other steps to prepare and configure a z/OS environment to successfully run Zowe.  Code is included for RACF, Top Secret, and ACF/2.
- The Zowe cross memory server installation script `zowe-install-apf-server.sh` is removed.  In this release, the steps for configuring z/OS security are included in the `ZWESECUR` JCL member.
- Previously, Zowe runs its two started tasks under the user ID of `IZUSVR` and admin of `IZUADMIN`.  These belong to z/OSMF and are no longer used in this release. Instead, Zowe includes two new user IDs of `ZWESVUSR` (for the main Zowe started task), `ZWESIUSR` (for the cross memory server), and `ZWEADMIN` as a group.  These user IDs are defaults and different ones can be used depending on site preferences.
- Previously, the main Zowe started task is called `ZOWESVR`. Now it is called `ZWESVSTC`.
- Previously, the cross memory started task is called `ZWESIS01`. Now it is called `ZWESISTC`.
- The script `zowe-verify.sh` is no longer included with Zowe. Now the verification is done at launch time and dependent on the launch configuration parameters. It is no longer done with a generic script function that `zowe-verify.sh` used to provide.

For more information about how to install Zowe z/OS components, see [Installation roadmap](../user-guide/install-zos.md).

#### API Mediation Layer
- The API Catalog backend has been modified to support the OpenAPI 3.0 version. The API Catalog now supports the display of API documentation in the OpenAPI 3.0 format.

- A new Eureka metadata definition has been developed to enable service registration that does not require using existing pre-prepared enablers. Both new and old metadata versions are supported by the Discovery Service. Corresponding documentation to onboard a service with the Zowe API ML without an onboarding enabler has also been refactored.

- The plain Java enabler has been redesigned for simple and straight-forward API service configuration. Configuration parameters have been refactored to remove duplicates and unused parameters, and improve consistency with other parameters. Documentation to Onboard a REST API service with the Plain Java Enabler (PJE) has also been refactored.


#### Zowe App Server
- The app server now issues a message indicating it is ready, how many plug-ins loaded, and where it can be accessed from [#355](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/issues/355)
- Restructured the App server directories to separate writable configuration items from read-only install content [#911](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/911) [#627](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/issues/627) [#87](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/87) [#43](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-build/pull/43)
- Move install-app script to instance directory bin folder for ease of use [#966](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/966)
- Access control for app visibility [216](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/issues/216)

    - UI changes for write support for datasets in editor [#340](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/issues/340)
    - Support for QSAM and VSAM deletion in the ZSS dataset REST API [#339](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/issues/339)
    - Editor: Dataset deletion capability[#229][#337]
    - Editor: File deletion UI changes [#338](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/issues/338)

    - Editor fix: Disable text area for datasets in the absence of write ability [#342](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/issues/342)
    - Editor fix: When saving a new file use the opened directory in the dialog [#233](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/issues/233)

#### Zowe CLI

- The Zowe CLI REST API now supports the following capabilities for managing data sets:
  - Rename sequential and partitioned data sets. [#571](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/571)
  - Migrate data sets. [#558](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/558)
  - Copy data sets to another data set and copy members to another member. [#578](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/578)
- The Zowe CLI REST API now supports HTTP ETags in response data. The ETag mechanism allows client applications to cache data more efficiently. ETAgs can also prevent simultaneous, conflicting updates to a resource. [#598](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/598)

### New features and enhancements

The following features and enhancements were added.

#### Zowe App Server

- A backup routine for when a non-administrator tries to access the API. Instead of executing privileged commands and failing, it will execute a command to get their profile, and return only the information in their scope. This is a feature that most people won't need, since you'd ideally want to be an administrator if you were using this API, but the functionality is there. ([#114](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/114))

- The ability to retrieve profiles only by prefix. This can be done by looking for a profile with a "." at the end. This will act as a wildcard which extracts everything matching that prefix. ([#114](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/114))

- Added a tomcat xml configuration file with substitutions for values (ports, keys, certificates) necessary for the App Server to manage one or more instances of Tomcat for hosting servlet dataservices. Also added a new section to the zluxserver.json file to describe dataservice providers such as the aforementioned Tomcat Java Servlet one. (#49)
- Added Swagger API documentation support. Application developers can include a Swagger 2.0 JSON or YAML file in the app's /doc/swagger directory for each REST data service. Each file must have the same name as the data service. Developers can then reference the files at runtime using a new app route: /ZLUX/plugins/PLUGINID/catalogs/swagger. They can reference individual services at: /ZLUX/plugins/PLUGINID/catalogs/swagger/SERVICENAME. If swagger documents are not present, the server will use contextual knowledge to show some default values. ([#159](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/issues/159))

  - Documented a known issue when the API ML stops accepting connections after z/OS TCP/IP is recycled in the _Troubleshooting API ML_.

## Version 1.0.1 (March 2019)

Version 1.0.1 contains the following changes since the last version.

### What's new in Zowe installation on z/OS

During product operation of the Zowe Cross Memory Server which was introduced in V1.0.0, the z/OSMF user ID IZUSVR or its equivalent must have UPDATE access to the BPX.SERVER and BPX.DAEMON FACILITY classes. The install script will do this automatically if the installing user has enough authority, or provide the commands to be issued manually if not. For more information, see [Installing the Zowe Cross Memory Server on z/OS](../user-guide/install-zos.html#installing-the-zowe-cross-memory-server-on-z-os)

### What's new in the Zowe App Server

- Made the following improvements to security:
  - Removed the insecure SHA1 cipher from the Zowe App Server's supported ciphers list.
  - Added instructions to REST APIs to not cache potentially sensitive response contents.
  - Set secure attributes to desktop and z/OSMF session cookies.
- Fixed a bug that caused the configuration data service to mishandle PUT operations with bodies that were not JSON.
- Fixed a bug that prevented IFrame applications from being selected by clicking on their contents.
- Fixed various bugs in the File Explorer and updated it to use newer API changes.
- Fixed a bug in which App2App Communication Actions could be duplicated upon logging in a second time on the same desktop.

### What's new in Zowe CLI

- Create and Manage z/OSMF Workflows using the new `zos-workflows` command group. For more information, see [Zowe CLI command groups.](../user-guide/cli-usingcli.md#zowe-cli-command-groups)

- Use the `@lts-incremental` tag when you install and update Zowe CLI core or plug-ins. The tag ensures that you don't consume breaking changes that affect your existing scripts. Installation procedures are updated to reflect this change.

- A [CLI quick start guide](cli-getting-started.md) is now available for users who are familiar with command-line tools and want to get up and running quickly.

- IBM CICS Plug-in for Zowe CLI was updated to support communication over HTTPS. Users can enable https by specifying `--protocol https` when creating a profile or issuing a command. For backwards compatibility, HTTP remains the default protocol.

### What's new in the Zowe REST APIs

Introduced new Unix files APIs that reside in the renamed API catalog tile `z/OS Datasets and Unix files service` (previously named `z/OS Datasets service`). You can use these APIs to:

- List the children of a Unix directory
- Get the contents of a Unix file

### What's changed

- **Zowe explorer apps**
   - JES Explorer: Enhanced Info/Error messages to better help users diagnose problems.
   - MVS Explorer: Fixed an issue where Info/Error messages were not displayed when loading a Dataset/Members contents.

## Version 1.0.0 (February 2019)

Version 1.0.0 contains the following changes since the Open Beta release.

### What's new in API Mediation Layer

- HTTPs is now supported on all Java enablers for onboarding API microservices with the API ML.

- SSO authentication using z/OSMF has been implemented for the API Catalog login.  Mainframe credentials are required for access.

### What's new in Zowe CLI

-  **Breaking change to Zowe CLI**: The `--pass` command option is changed to `--password` for all core Zowe CLI commands for clarity and to be consistent with plug-ins. If you have zosmf profiles that you created prior to January 11, 2019, you must recreate them to use the `--password` option. The aliases `--pw` and `--pass` still function when you issue commands as they did prior to this breaking change. You do not need to modify scripts that use  `--pass`.

- The `@next` npm tag used to install Zowe CLI is deprecated. Use the `@latest` npm tag to install the product with the online registry method.

### What's new in the Zowe Desktop

- You can now obtain information about an application by right-clicking on an application icon and then clicking **Properties**.

- To view version information for the desktop, click the avatar in the lower right corner of the desktop.

- Additional information was added for the Workflow application.

- The titlebar of the active window is now colored to give an at-a-glance indication of which window is in the foreground.

- Window titlebar maximize button now changes style to indicate whether a window is maximized.

- Windows now have a slight border around them to help see boundaries and determine which window is active.

- Multiple instances of the same application can be opened and tracked from the launchbar. To open multiple instances, right-click and choose **Open New**.
Once multiple instances are open, you can click the application icon to select which application to bring to the foreground. The number of orbs below the application icon relates to the number of instances of the application that is open.

- Desktop framework logging trimmed and formalized to the Zowe App Logger. For more information, see [https://github.com/zowe/zlux/wiki/Logging](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/wiki/Logging).

- The UriBroker was updated to support dataservice versioning and UNIX file API updates.

- Removed error messages about missing `components.js` by making this optional component explicitly declared within an application. By using the property "webContent.hasComponents = true/false".

- Set the maximum username and password length for login to 100 characters each.

- Applications can now list webContent.framework = "angular" as an alias for "angular2".

- Fixed a bug where the desktop might not load on high latency networks.

### What's new in the Zowe App Server

- HTTP support was disabled in favor of HTTPS-only hosting.

- The server can be configured to bind to specific IPs or to hostnames. Previously, the server would listen on all interfaces. For more information, see [https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/30](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/30).

- The core logger prefixes for the Zowe App Server were changed from "_unp" to "_zsf".

- Dataservices are now versioned, and dataservices can depend on specific versions of other dataservices. A plug-in can include more than one version of a dataservice for compatibility. For more information, see [https://github.com/zowe/zlux/wiki/ZLUX-Dataservices](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/wiki/ZLUX-Dataservices).

- Support to communicate with the API Mediation Layer with the use of keys and certificates was added.

- Trimmed and corrected error messages regarding unconfigured proxies for clarity and understanding. For more information, see [https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/33](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/33).

- Fixed the `nodeCluster.sh` script to have its logging and environment variable behavior consistent with `nodeServer.sh`.

- Removed the "swaggerui" plug-in in favor of the API Catalog.

- Bugfix for `/plugins` API to not show the installation location of the plug-in.

- Bugfix to print a warning if the server finds two plug-ins with the same name.

- Added the ability to conditionally add HTTP headers for secure services to instruct the browser not to cache the responses. For more information, see [https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/issues/36](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/issues/36).

- Added a startup check to confirm that ZSS is running as a prerequisite of the Zowe App Server.

- Bugfix for sending HTTP 404 response when content is missing, instead of a request hanging.

- Added tracing of login, logout, and HTTP routing so that administrators can track access.

### What's changed

- Previously,  APIs for z/OS Jobs services and z/OS Data Set services are provided unsing an IBM WebSphere Liberty web application server. In this release, they are provided using a Tomcat web application server. You can view the associated API documentation corresponding to the z/OS services through the API Catalog.

- References to `zlux-example-server` were changed to `zlux-app-server` and references to `zlux-proxy-server` were changed to `zlux-server-framework`.

### Known issues

**Paste operations from the Zowe Desktop TN3270 and VT Terminal applications**

**TN3270 App** - If you are using Firefox, the option to use Ctrl+V to paste is not available. Instead, press Shift + right-click to access the paste option through the context menu.

Pressing Ctrl+V will perform paste for the TN3270 App on other browsers.

**VT Terminal App** - In the VT Terminal App, Ctrl+V will not perform a paste operation for any browser.

**Note:** In both terminals, press Shift + right-click to access copy and paste options through the context menu.

**z/OS Subsystems App** - The z/OS Subsystems application is being removed temporarily for the 1.0 release.  The reason is that as the ZSS has transitioned from closed to open source some APIs needed to be re-worked and are not complete yet.  Look for the return of the application in a future update.
