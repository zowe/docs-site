## Version 1.19.1 LTS (February 2021)

### Notable changes 

**SMPE PTF**

With the continuous optimization of the Zowe build size, now the Zowe release can fit in one PTF. This single PTF UO01969 will supersede PTF UO01967 and UO01968 from the v1.19.0 release.

### New features and enhancements

#### Zowe CLI

The following enhancements were added to the **core CLI**:

- Updated Imperative version to support npm@7. This fixes an error when installing plugins.

The following enhancements were added in the **Imperative CLI Framework**:

- Fixed plugin install commands which were broken in npm@7. [#457](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/457)

### Bug fixes

#### SMPE PTF

- Fixed the missing HOLD data about extra steps the system programmer should take after applying the PTF. It explains new configuration options that are introduced in `instance.env` and also a reconfiguration step where `zowe-configure-instance.sh` is mandatory.

#### Zowe CLI

The following bugs were fixed in the **Imperative CLI Framework**:

- Fixed incorrect formatting of code blocks in web help. [#535](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/535)

## Version 1.19.0 LTS (February 2021)

### Notable changes 

**Package manifest and component installer**

Each Zowe extension and each core component can now use a manifest file to describe itself. The manifest file defines the name and purpose of the component. It also provides information about how this component should be installed, configured, started and tested. For more information, see [Packaging z/OS extensions](../extend/packaging-zos-extensions.md).

Two tools, `zowe-install-component.sh` and `zowe-configure-component.sh`, are introduced in this release for technical preview. The `zowe-install-component.sh` helps you install any Zowe server component (extension). Zowe core components are also installed with this tool. The `zowe-configure-component.sh` tool helps you configure an installed Zowe server component (extension) for a Zowe instance. Zowe core components are also configured with this tool. In order to be compatible with the tools, it is recommended that the components follow [Zowe server component package format standard](../extend/packaging-zos-extensions.md#zowe-server-component-package-format).

**X.509 client certificate authentication support for API Mediation Layer (Technical Preview)**

This feature is released for technical preview in Zowe 1.19. Previously, users were required to provide credentials (usually basic authentication) to make a login call against the API Gateway. From release 1.19 you can now use the x509 client certificate for calls to authenticate in the API ML, whereby information from the certificate verifies the user's identity through SAF and then returns a proper JWT.  

If you would like to offer feedback about using client certificate authentication, please create an issue against the Zowe `api-layer` repository.

**Standalone run of Zowe API Mediation Layer**

You can now start the API Mediation Layer independently of other Zowe components. This allows you to minimize the resources used when you use Zowe as a Devops tool instead of a Virtual Desktop tool.

## Version 1.18.0 LTS (January 2021)

### Notable changes 

**Zowe Docker build Technical Preview is available** 

The Zowe Docker build enables you to run a subset of the Zowe server-side components outside z/OS. The Docker build runs in combination with the convenience or SMP/E build. You can download the build directly via the .tar file, or as a cloud download from Docker Hub. Separate downloads exist for z/Linux ("s390x") and other Linux ("amd64" for intel & amd systems).

For more information, see [Docker Installation Roadmap](../user-guide/install-docker.md). To download the Docker build technical preview, visit [Zowe.org](https://www.zowe.org/download.html).  


### New features and enhancements

#### Zowe API Mediation Layer
- Version 1.18.0 introduces a feature allowing users to run the Zowe API Mediation Layer as a standalone component. After downloading and installing the current Zowe SMPE package, you can then configure and deploy only the Zowe API Mediation Layer without the other Zowe components. [#856](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/856)
- You can now configure more detailed logging outside of Spool. [#709](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/709)
- High Availability: The start script per API ML service has been componentized. You can now launch and restart API Mediation Layer components individually. [#862](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/862)
- High Availability: It is now possible to distinguish between internal and external traffic through port separation, whereby each port uses a unique certificate; one presenting an internal certificate, and the other an external certificate. [#910](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/910)
- API version is now automatically set to the version tab selected in the API Catalog so users can easily grab the Base Path. [#943](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/943)
- API Catalog versioning has been improved with the addition of the API differences tab. This feature enables you to compare versions of two APIs. [#923](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/923)

#### Zowe App Server

- The Zowe App Framework's "single app mode" is now based on code shared with the Desktop, allowing it to support the Desktop's notification API and app2app communication. [#67](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-platform/pull/67) [#292](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-manager/pull/292)
  - This is backward compatible with apps that have previously used single app mode. 
  - In the case where app2app communication is used and spawns a second app, that app will spawn in a window but will not be able to be minimized due to single app mode having no Desktop, and therefore no way to restore a minimized window.
- ZSS plug-ins can now issue HTTP requests as HTTP clients, provided by a new library in zowe-common-c. [#179](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/179)

#### Zowe CLI

The following enhancements were added to the **core CLI**:

- Added a `--replace` option to the `zowe zos-files copy data-set` command. Use this option if you want to replace like-named members in the target data set. [#808](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/808)
- Improved a cryptic error message that was shown if the TSO address space failed to start for the `zowe zos-tso issue command` command. [#28](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/28)

The following enhancements were added to the **Imperative CLI Framework**:
- Added an `arrayAllowDuplicate` option to the `ICommandOptionDefinition` interface. By default, the option value is set to `true` and duplicate values are allowed in an array. Specify `false` if you want Imperative to throw an error for duplicate array values. [#437](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/437)
- Expose `trim` parameter from `wrap-ansi` within `TextUtils.wordWrap()`

The following enhancement was added to the **IBM Db2 Plug-in**:
- Added a help example for how to pass output values when calling a Db2 stored procedure.

The following enhancement was added to the **FTP Plug-in**:
- Move the reusable code from handlers to api folder.

- The warning messages on the zss server startup have been removed due to a shell syntax problem. [#238](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/238)
- In previous versions, static app2app recognizers would not be loaded from storage because they were treated as actions instead of as recognizers. This issue has been resolved in this release. [#297](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-manager/pull/297)

#### Zowe CLI

The following bugs were fixed in the **core CLI**:
- Removed "[object Object]" text that appeared in some error messages. The proper text "Imperative API Error" is now displayed. [#836](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/836)
- Improved performance of `zowe zos-files list` commands when long lists are printed to console. [#861](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/861)

- You can now start ZSS independent of the Zowe Application Framework server by specifying the `LAUNCH_COMPONENT_GROUP "ZSS"`. If `DESKTOP` is specified instead of `ZSS`, ZSS will still be included as a prerequisite to the Application Framework server. [#1632](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1632)
- Zowe instance configuration script (`zowe-configure-instance.sh`) can now skip checking for Node.js by passing in the `-s` flag since Node.js may not be needed if the components to be launched don't require it. [#1677](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1677)
- The `run-zowe.sh` script can also skip the checking for Node.js by setting the environment variable `SKIP_NODE=1` for the cases where the components to be launched don't require Node.js.
- Exported the `EXTERNAL_CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITIES` variable to the `zowe-certificates.env` file such that it may be used by the Application Framework server. [#1742](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1742)

#### Zowe App Server
<!--Pulled from https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/blob/staging/CHANGELOG.md-->
- Make use of external certificate authorities referenced during keystore setup time.
- ZSS startup would issue warnings about failure to write yml files for APIML in the case APIML was not also being used.
- Bugfix: In previous versions, external certificate authorities were not registered with the app server properly and would sometimes contribute to a SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN error when using the mediation layer. This issue has been resolved by adding external CA certs to the app-server CA array. [#138](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/community-5c93e02fa70b456d35b8f0ed/issues/zowe/zlux-app-server/138)

#### Zowe CLI

## Version 1.16.0 LTS (October 2020)

### Notable changes

**Certificate management and keyring support**

- In V1.15, the JCL member `ZWEKRING` was added to the sample PDS library `SZWESAMP`.  This member contains commands to create a keyring that can contain the Zowe certificate(s) and a local certificate authority. In this release, the JCL member `ZWENOKYR` was added to `SZWESAMP` that contains the inverse commands, so it can be used to remove the keyring, the Zowe certificate(s), and the certificate authority.
- In V1.15, the JCL member `ZWEKRING` and the supporting code in the Zowe runtimes for working with certificates held in keyrings were provided in beta format for early technical preview for RACF only. In this release, the commands in `ZWEKRING`, `ZWENOKYR` and the supporting code in the Zowe runtimes for working with keyrings and certificates in RACF, TopSecret, and ACF/2 are now a supported piece of functionality.
- A new documentation section is added to help you understand the configuration scenarios around Zowe certificates, and the relationship to a Zowe instance directory and Zowe runtime. See [Topology for the Zowe z/OS launch process](../user-guide/installandconfig.md#topology-of-the-zowe-z-os-launch-process).

**Additional TN3270 terminal configuration options**

Additional TN3270 terminal configuration options can now be specified within the `instance.env` configuration file. These choices, such as codepage and terminal dimensions, affect server defaults but do not change the pre-existing ability for you to set your own preferences within the Desktop at runtime. A list of the available options can be found [here](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/108).

### New features and enhancements

The following features and enhancements were added.

#### Zowe installation
<!-- Pulled from https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/blob/staging/CHANGELOG.md. Based on version number. Includes 1.16.0 changes.-->

#### Zowe App Server
- The `install-app.sh` script used to install App Server plugins can now be used without Node.js. If Node.js is not detected when the script is executed, this behavior will be automated. You can also force this behavior with the environment variable `INSTALL_NO_NODE=1`, such as in the following example:
  - `INSTALL_NO_NODE=1 ./install-app.sh ~/zlux-editor` [#137](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/137)
- ZSS is now automatically registered to the API Mediation Layer when both are present, using a static registration file. [#208](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/208)
- Additional environment variables are now supported, which provides more options for TN3270 for the `instance.env` configuration file [#1176](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/issues/1176) while also allowing TN3270 host to be specified during installation configuration. [#1125](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/issues/1125). The following new environment variables are now supported in `instance.env` [#108](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/108):

  - `ZOWE_ZLUX_TELNET_HOST = string`
  - `ZOWE_ZLUX_SSH_HOST = string`
  - `ZOWE_ZLUX_TN3270_ROW = number`
  - `ZOWE_ZLUX_TN3270_COL = number`
  - `ZOWE_ZLUX_TN3270_MOD = numbers 2-5 as well as "dynamic" or other variations of the word`
  - `ZOWE_ZLUX_TN3270_CODEPAGE = ccsid number or string as seen in the ui`
- The Agent API now provides limited information without the need for authentication. Non-admins are able to view a subset of the information available to admins, specifically regarding the functionality of Zowe.  Examples of the information available to non-admins are: OS architecture and environment variables for Zowe configuration such as the components used and the ports they are accessible on. [#211](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/211)
  - `/server/agent/environment (limited info)`
  - `/server/agent/services`
- The ZSS `/unixfile` API has been updated to include an option to force file content to be sent or received as a specific encoding. If not specified, the pre-existing behavior of automatically choosing encoding based on tagging and file extensions will be used. [#160](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/160)
- The app server can now read and use keys, certificates, and certificate authorities contained with PKCS12 files. This is in addition to existing support for PEM-encoded files as well as z/OS keyrings. [#244](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/244)

#### Zowe CLI
<!-- Pulled from https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md. Based on change history, pull updates after last release. Includes 6.23.0. -->

The following enhancements were added to the **core CLI**:
- Added a `--pattern` option to the `zowe files list all-members` command. The option lets you restrict returned member names to only names that match a given pattern. The argument syntax is the same as the "pattern" parameter of the ISPF LMMLIST service. [#810](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/810)
- Added new options `--lrecl` and `--recfm` to the `zos-files create` command. Use these options to specify a logical record length and record format for data sets that you create. [#788](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/788)

#### Zowe Explorer

### Bug fixes

The following bugs were fixed.

#### Zowe API Mediation Layer
- Changed the default expiration time value for JWT token to 8h for consistency with the z/OSMF default. [#615](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/615)
- Reduced excessive and unhelpful log messages. [#672](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/672)
- Added the Base Path field in the API Catalog if one is available, which can override the Swagger Base Path. This causes the proper Base Path to be displayed in the event that the api doc is not populated properly. [#810](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/810)
- Removed overwriting of the Swagger Base Path, which resulted in malformed API routes when the base URL is shared among multiple services. [#852](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/852)
- API ML was previously not reporting SSL certificate errors when servers were unable to communicate. Now, if a SSLException occurs, SSL certificate errors are reported.  [#698](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/698)
- Fixed language in log messages for consistency. [#830](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/830)

#### Zowe App Server

In previous versions, the environment `arch` and `os` fields were incorrect. This has been fixed, and the updated response from `/server/agent/environment` service is [#213](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/213):

```
{
  "agentName": "zss",
  "agentVersion": "1.15.0+20200903",

## Version 1.15.0 LTS (September 2020)

### Notable changes

<!-- Document the key highlights of Zowe in this release in details. You can explain the benefits of a feature/enhancement, add examples, and optionally include graphics or GIFs to demo how it looks, and so on. Use the feature/enhancement name as the title. Example: "Validate only mode: Zowe z/OS installation now supports a validate only mode. This allows you to check whether all the component validation checks of the Zowe installation pass without starting any of the components. ...... -->

**Keyring support**

Prior to v1.15, the Zowe z/OS components were only able to use a certificate held in a USS Java KeyStore.  In v1.15, the Zowe z/OS components can now use a certificate that is held in a z/OS keyring as described in [Configuring Zowe certificates in a keyring](../user-guide/configure-certificates-keyring.md).

For more information about Zowe certificates, certificate authorities, trust stores, and how they are used by Zowe, see [Configuring Zowe Certificates](../user-guide/configure-certificates.md).

**Auto-Save plug-in data**

Plug-in developers can now make use of the new autosave feature, which can automatically save state data based on what the developer intends to retain, at regular time intervals. This is to protect against client crashes, and in the case of a crash, the apps are reopened upon desktop login and restored with the saved state. This new capability furthers the larger goal of high availability and fault tolerance for all Zowe components.

**Support for starting Zowe API ML without z/OSMF on your system**

By default, the API Gateway uses z/OSMF as an authentication provider. With the release of Zowe 1.15 it is now possible to switch to SAF as the authentication provider instead of z/OSMF. So, if you want to securely run the Zowe API ML but your system does not have z/OSMF, simply select SAF as your authentication provider. For more information on how to switch to SAF, see [API Gateway configuration parameters](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/blob/docs-staging/docs/user-guide/api-mediation/api-gateway-configuration.md#apimlsecurityauthprovider).

### New features and enhancements

<!-- If there is a corresponding GitHub issue, please also include the GitHub issue number. See v1.3.0 release notes as an example.-->

The following features and enhancements were added:

#### Zowe API Mediation Layer
<!-- Pulled from https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1150. Based on release number.-->
- The API Path Pattern now supports `serviceId` as the first element. This improves the consistency of the URL when processing through the Gateway or outside of the Gateway. [#688](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/688)
- The SAF Provider can now be used as a possible authentication provider. This removes the API ML dependency on z/OSMF for authentication enabling SAF to obtain the JWT. [#472](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/472)
- The Swagger URL is now provided for z/OSMF. This URL provides full documentation containing the Try It Out functionality if the z/OSMF version supports the Swagger endpoint. Alternatively, the URL provides the info endpoint to directly enable access to Zowe endpoints. [#665](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/665)
- The default configuration of API ML now supports character encoding. [#777](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/777)

#### ZSS

A new endpoint has been added to the Agent API. This new endpoint will return a list of services to the user. [#209](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/209)
- Sample request: `GET /server/agent/services`
- Sample response:

```
{
  "services": [
     {
      "name": "plugin definitions service",
      "urlMask": "/plugins",
      "type": "REST"
    },

}
```

#### Zowe App Server

- Added a feature that allows users to auto save plug-in data by subscribing to the event. By default, the feature will auto save every 5 minutes, but this interval can be customized. [#250](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-manager/pull/250)
  - This feature is enabled via the Plugin Definition. `"autosave": true`
- You are now able to select multiple jobs in the job tree, which allows for functions such as purging multiple jobs at once. [#274](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/issues/274), [#204](https://github.com/zowe/explorer-jes/pull/204)

#### Zowe CLI

- Added a `--responseTimeout` option to the z/OS Files APIs, CLI commands, and z/OSMF profiles. Specify `--responseTimeout <###>` to set the number of seconds that the TSO servlet request runs before a timeout occurs. The default is 30 seconds. You can set the option to 5 - 600 seconds (inclusive). [#760](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/760)
- Added the `--encoding` option for the `zowe zos-files upload dir-to-pds` command. This option lets you upload multiple members with a single command. [#764](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/764)

The following features and enhancements were added to the **Imperative CLI Framework**:
<!-- Pulled from https://github.com/zowe/imperative/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md. Based on change history and date, pull updates after last release publish date Aug 13. Includes 4.7.6, 4.8.0, 4.8.1. -->

- Added support for dynamically generated cookie names. Updated `AbstractSession.storeCookie()` to process cookie names that are not fully known at build-time. [#431](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/pull/431)
- Added the SSO Callback function, which allows applications to call their own functions while validating session properties (that is, host, port, user, password, token, and so on). The callback option is named `getValuesBack`. [#422](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/422)

The following features and enhancements were added to the **Secure Credential Store Plug-in**:
<!-- Pulled from https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-scs-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md. Based on change history and date, pull updates after last release publish date Aug 13. Includes 4.1.0. -->

### Bug fixes

The following bugs were fixed.

#### Zowe API Mediation Layer
<!-- Pulled from https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1150. Based on release number.-->
- Fixed SSL validation when Eureka is running in HTTP mode. When the scheme is HTTP, SSL configuration is not verified since it is not used. [#792](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/792)
- Fixed a problem in error handling when no api-doc is available. Now a specific return code and message is generated when a problem occurs when obtaining or transforming the api-doc. [#571](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/571)

#### ZSS

- When RBAC is disabled, only the following services will be available. [#210](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/210)
  - `/server/agent/environment` (with limited information)
  - `/server/agent/services`

#### Zowe App Server

- External CA certificates to the Zowe `ZWED_node_https_certificateAuthorities array` only after checking to see if the certificates exist, which prevents it from pointing to nothing, resulting in it breaking. [#136](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/136)
- In previous versions, the `component.json` file was only being created when users upgraded their Zowe system to a more recent version. Performing an initial installation would not result in the `component.json` file being created. In this version, this bug has been resolved, and the `component.json` file is created both when upgrading and performing an initial installation. [#135](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/135)

#### Zowe CLI

The following bugs were fixed in the **core CLI**:
- Renamed the z/OS Files API option from `storeclass` to `storclass`. This fixed an issue where the CLI could define the wrong storage class on `create dataset` commands. [#503](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/503)
- Fixed an issue where the output of the `zowe zos-uss issue ssh` command would sometimes omit the last line. [#795](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/795)

The following bug was fixed in the **Imperative CLI Framework**:
- Fixed an issue with `ConnectionPropsForSessCfg` where the user would be prompted for user/password even if a token was present. [#436](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/pull/436)

<!--#### Zowe Explorer -->

## Version 1.14.0 LTS (August 2020)

### Notable changes
<!-- Document the key highlights of Zowe in this release in details. You can explain the benefits of a feature/enhancement, add examples, and optionally include graphics or GIFs to demo how it looks, and so on. Use the feature/enhancement name as the title. Example: "Validate only mode: Zowe z/OS installation now supports a validate only mode. This allows you to check whether all the component validation checks of the Zowe installation pass without starting any of the components. ...... -->

**Zowe Node APIs**

Did you know that you can leverage the Zowe Node APIs directly? The Zowe Node APIs are the programmatic APIs that enable Zowe CLI to interface with the mainframe. You can use the APIs to build your own applications or automation scripts, independent of Zowe CLI. For more information and usage examples, see the [Zowe CLI readme file](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli#using-the-zowe-node-apis).

**Support for verifying Zowe release integrity**

Zowe now provides a new tool to verify that the code in the Zowe runtime directory installed on your z/OS® system is identical to the released code. The tool comprises a script file `zowe-verify-authenticity.sh`, plus the files it needs to check the release contents.

If the contents of the Zowe runtime directory have been modified, then it may result in unpredictable behavior. For more information about the tool, see [Verify Zowe runtime directory](../troubleshoot/verify-fingerprint.md).

### New features and enhancements

<!-- If there is a corresponding GitHub issue, please also include the GitHub issue number. See v1.3.0 release notes as an example.-->

The following features and enhancements were added.

#### Zowe installation

- If you are upgrading to Zowe v1.14 from a previous release,
and the value of `ZOWE_EXPLORER_HOST` does not match the host and domain that you put into your browser to access Zowe, you must update your configuration due to updated referrer-based security. See [System Requirements](../user-guide/systemrequirements.md#important_note_for_users_upgrading_to_v1.14) for information on updating your configuration.
- Allow the user to verify the authenticity of a Zowe driver. The script `zowe-verify-authenticity.sh` will check that a Zowe `ROOT_DIR` for an installed release matches the contents for when that release was created, which assists with support and troubleshooting. To verify pre-1.14 releases, the script and its associated code are available [separately](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/blob/staging/files/fingerprint.pax) (see [#1552](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/issues/1552)). For more information, see the new topic [Verify Zowe Runtime Directory](../troubleshoot/verify-fingerprint.md) that describes the operation of the script.
- Allow multiple domains (names/IP Addresses) when generating certificates. This also includes SMP/E `HOLDDATA` for the affected function `Zowe Configuration`. [#1511](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/issues/1511)
- Included z/OSMF workflows for Zowe z/OS configuration. [#1527](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/issues/1527)
- Added warning if `ZWESVSTC` runs under user ID `IZUSVR`. [#1534](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/issues/1534)
- [Docs] Changed the documentation so that SZWEAUTH PDSE load library members should not be copied elsewhere, but instead the original installation target SZWEAUTH PDSE should be APF-authorized and used as the runtime load library.  This also includes SMP/E `HOLDDATA` for the affected function `STC JCL` as well as changes to topics [Installing and configuring the Zowe cross memory server (ZWESISTC)](../user-guide/configure-xmem-server.md) and [Installing and starting the Zowe started task (ZWESVSTC)](../user-guide/configure-zowe-server.md).
- [Docs] Added a new topic [Installing and configuring Zowe z/OS components using scripts](../user-guide/scripted-configure-server.md).

#### API Mediation Layer

- Prevented crashing of API ML when null routes are set. [#767](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/pull/767)
- Added support to the X-Forwarded-* Headers. [#769](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/pull/769)
- Improved the configuration validator for the enablers to improve message specificity when one or more parameters required for setup are missing. [#760](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/pull/760)

#### Zowe App Server

- Using a cross-memory server without `REUSASID=YES` may result in an ASID shortage. This pull-request adds a check that will print a warning if `REUSASID=YES` is not detected. [#145](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/145)
- In previous versions, the server used the property `InstanceID` instead of `ZOWE_INSTANCE`. In order to maintain backwards compatibility, these properties are now unified when the value of `ZOWE_INSTANCE` is non-default. Additionally, the server uses these values whenever an instance number is needed, such as in the case of determining profile names for RBAC use [#130](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/130)
- The packaged size of the Editor has been significantly reduced by removing uncompressed versions of files that have compressed variants and `.map` files which were used for development debugging.  [#160](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/zowe-apps-5ce5829c1c7e0448d98d961e/issues/zowe/zlux-editor/160)
- The ZSS /unixfile REST API now supports the changing of permissions on a file or folder, similar to `chmod`, by calling /unixfile/chmod. The behavior is documented [in swagger](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/blob/rc/doc/swagger/fileapi.yaml). [#195](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/195) [#132](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/132)
- A notification will be displayed when users attempt to upload a wallpaper image that is too large. [#254](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-manager/pull/254)
- The desktop personalization panel's color selection UI now has an extra highlight around the selected color to make the selection more apparent. [#236](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-manager/pull/236)
- Users can now recall migrated datasets in the Editor (via the File Tree) by clicking on them. [#78](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-file-explorer/pull/78)

#### Zowe CLI

The following features and enhancements were added to the **core CLI**:

- Added the command `zowe zos-files delete migrated-data-sets` to delete migrated data sets. [#716](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/716)
- Added a new `--fail-fast` option to the `zowe zos-files download all-members` command. The option defaults to `true`, which preserves existing behavior. Set the option to `false` to continue downloading members if one or more of the downloads fails. [#759](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/759)
- Updated the Imperative CLI Framework version. [#744](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/774)

**z/OS FTP Plug-in for Zowe CLI**:

The following enhancement was added to the z/OS FTP Plug-in:
- The following flags were added to the `zowe zos-ftp submit data-set ` command: [#55](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-ftp-plugin/pull/55)
  - `--wait` - Specify a query interval and max times to query as comma-separated, numeric values. For example, specify `5,12` to query the job status every 5 seconds up to 12 times.
  - `--wait-for-output` - Wait for the job to enter OUTPUT status.
  - `--wait-for-active` - Wait for the job to enter ACTIVE status.

#### Zowe Explorer

The following features and enhancements were added to the **Zowe Explorer**:

- Added a webpack that works with localization and logging.
- Allowed extenders to load the saved profile sessions upon activation.
- Added an automatic re-validation for invalid profiles.

Also, check out [the Zowe Explorer FAQ](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/getting-started/freqaskques.html#zowe-explorer-faq) to learn more about the purpose and function of the VS Code extension.

### Bug fixes

The following bugs were fixed.

#### Zowe App Server

- Bugfix: ZSS will now maintain the connection if users respond to the 404 message with the request `Connection: Keep-Alive` [#147](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/147)
  - **NOTE:** The code only recognizes `Connection: Keep-Alive`.  Other "Keep-Alive" properties will be ignored.
- Bugfix: If a load module is incorrectly copied to STEPLIB, the z/OS loader will fail to load it. In these cases, an available copy in LPA will be used instead, if one is available. The problem with LPA is that any IDENTIFY calls to a module with an incorrect version number may cause serious issues. This pull-request ensures that ZWESIS01 comes from private storage. [#146](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/146)
- Bugfix: Fixes various issues that would occur when the number in the `Content-length` response header was different from the actual content length. [#150](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/150)
- Bugfixes for default plugin config and terminal handler location. This change was made in order to include the `_internal` folder. `storageDefaults` other than `_internal` are already supported. For more information, see the [wiki](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/wiki/Configuration-Dataservice#packaging-defaults). [#229](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/229)
  - This fix allows the server-side plugin config to exist within its own folder, rather than in the instance directory. As a result, plugins no longer have to perform a copy operation during installation.
  - You can now specify terminal proxy handler overrides within `$INSTANCE_DIR`, which was previously only possible within `$ROOT_DIR`. `$ROOT_DIR` modification is not recommended and not conformant for Zowe plugins.
- Bugfix: The process of auto-converting untagged USS ebcdic files when using the ZSS /unixfile REST API has been improved by determining if the files are text or binary based on a list of file extensions. The API behavior towards unknown extensions has been changed from assuming text to now assuming binary. This fixed some cases where text files were not readable through the REST API. [#148](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/148) [#152](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/152)
- Bugfix: When using ZSS's /unixfile/contents REST API, large files would occasionally cause an incorrect HTTP message to be sent because the content-length header did not match the actual content length. This could result when there is a conversion error. This issue has been solved by updating the API, allowing it to use the transfer encoding type "chunked" instead, which allows these previously broken files to be sent successfully. [#150](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/150)
- Bugfix: Some file actions in the Editor would generate URLs that included multiple slashes in a row, which may cause errors on servers that receive such requests. In this update, the URI Broker now removes multiple slashes when they are encountered, which may additionally improve behavior in other apps that use the URI Broker for the ZSS REST API /unixfile. [#251](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-manager/pull/251)
- Bugfix: During ZSS initialization, certain warning log messages were not displayed, such as the warning about lack of permission to use ICSF to generate a random number. This issue has been resolved by initializing the logger responsible for issuing the messages. [#143](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/143)
- Bugfix: In order to conserve log space, ZSS no longer prints debug information regarding HTTP dispatch. [#156](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/156)
- Bugfix: In previous versions, the app framework build process referenced webpack incorrectly, leading to an unnecessary build-time error if webpack was not installed globally. This issue has been resolved. [#248](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-manager/pull/248)
- Bugfix: In previous versions, developing with the app framework would show linting warnings in VSCode. This issue has been resolved by updating tsconfig.json [#240](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-manager/pull/240)
- Bugfix: Some app server configuration values could not be specified via environment variables due to the limited characters allowed in variables. A new syntax has been made to allow these edge-case configuration values to be specified, and this new syntax is seen here: [#230](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/230)
  - Overall behavior is described [in the wiki](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/wiki/Configuration-overriding).

#### Zowe CLI

The following bug was fixed in Imperative CLI Framework:

- Fix update profile API storing secure fields incorrectly when called without CLI args.
- Fixed a compilation error when building the CLI from source.[#770](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/770)

#### Zowe Explorer

- Fixed the bug related to saving USS files.
- Fixed the bug related to the deletion of datasets.

## Version 1.13.0 LTS (July 2020)

### Notable changes

Zowe CLI added the ability to access mainframe services through API Mediation Layer using single-sign on (SSO) and multi-factor authentication (MFA). Use Zowe CLI to log in to API Mediation Layer and receive a token that is used for secure authentication to one or more services. For more information, see [Integrating CLI with API Mediation Layer](../user-guide/cli-usingcli.md#integrating-with-api-mediation-layer).

The CLI also supports a type of profile named "base profile" that lets you store configuration information for multiple services. For more information, see [Using Profiles](../user-guide/cli-usingcli.md#using-profiles).

### New features and enhancements

The following features and enhancements were added.

#### Zowe installation

- Updated `zowe-configure-instance` upgrade to update ROOT_DIR. This allows you to move the Zowe runtime to a different place when you install a new version of Zowe. [#1414](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1414)
- Updated the port validation logic to reduce false negatives. [#1399](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1399)
- Updated the Zowe installation and configuration to tolerate ZERT Network Analyzer better. [#1124](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1124)

#### API Mediation Layer

- Added Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Headers Support.
- Introduced an option to set connection timeout for a service.
- Provided SAF Keyrings support for a ZAAS Client.
- Introduced Spring Boot enabler configuration validation.

#### Zowe App Server

- The app server is now able to use more than one certificate authority (CA). This allows the server to validate other server's authenticity by recognizing the CA that another server may have used [#128](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/128)
- The `dispatcher.invokeAction` method now returns promise, which provides the ability to wait until `dispatcher.invokeAction` finishes and handles errors [#59](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-platform/pull/59)
- The ngx-color picker has been replaced by a custom hue selection bar, lightness swatches bar, and color palette, allowing for a more customizable personalization experience [#235](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-manager/pull/235)
- In this version, cross-launch via URL has been implemented, allowing for integration between the Application Framework and applications. This feature enables users to bookmark a set of app2app communication actions (in the form of a URL) that will be executed when opening the webpage [#234](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-manager/pull/234)
- Bookmarking features have been added to the TN3270 emulator [#30](https://github.com/zowe/tn3270-ng2/pull/30)
  - Users can now save connection preferences on a per-user level. Clicking the floppy disk icon saves user settings to that user's scope.
  - Codepages have been reorganized so that the numbers are shown first, making it easier for users to navigate to their favorites
  - The buttons found in this feature have been realigned
- Several features have been added to the Zowe Editor [#153](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-editor/pull/153)
  - Globally increased the shortest duration of snackbar notifications from 2 seconds to 3 seconds
  - Added a "Close All" button in the menu (hot key is Alt + W + Shift)
  - A snackbar notification will be displayed when users attempt to open a file that they do not have permission to open
  - Added an "Undo" option to the Close All feature to reopen tabs & files
- Login activity and session activity is now synchronized across multiple desktop tabs [#242](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-manager/pull/242)
  - When a user logs out of a desktop tab, all other active tabs will also log out
  - When a user performs an action on a desktop tab, the other tabs register this activity, which stops them from timing out

#### Zowe CLI

The following features and enhancements were added to the **core Zowe CLI**:

- Added the ability to log into and out of API ML using a token. [#718](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/718)
- Added the `--base-profile` option to all commands that use profiles to let them make use of base profiles that contain shared values. [#718](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/718)
- CLI commands now prompt for any of the following option values if the option is missing: host, port, user, and password. [#718](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/718)
- Added character encoding/code page support for download and upload data set operations in the API library and the CLI. [#632](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/632)
- Added the `--encoding` option to the `zosmf` profile type. [#632](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/632)
- Introduced an API to delete migrated data sets. [#715](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/715).

The following features and enhancements were added to the **Imperative CLI Framework**:

- Added the `ConnectionPropsForSessCfg.addPropsOrPrompt` function to store credentials, such as a token, in a session configuration object. [#718](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/718)
    - CLI plug-ins must implement this function to create sessions in order to consume automatic token-handling and prompt for mission options features.
    - Connection information is obtained from the command line in the following order: Environment variables, service profiles, base profiles, or a default option value.
    - If connection information is not supplied to any core CLI command, the user is prompted for:
        -  host
        -  port
        -  user
        -  password

      The prompt times out after 30 seconds so that automated scripts will not fail.
- Added base profiles, a type of profile that can store values and provide them to other profile types, such as zosmf profiles. [#402](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/pull/402)

  The following properties can be stored in a base profile:

  - host
  - port
  - user
  - password
  - rejectUnauthorized
  - tokenType
  - tokenValue
- Added `login` and `logout` commands to retrieve and delete tokens. [#405](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/405)
  - Added a `showToken` flag to display the token and not save it to the user profile.
  - Added the ability to create a user profile upon login, if no profile of that type existed previously.
- Added the `--dd` flag, which lets users create a profile without using the default values specified for that profile. [#718](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/718)
- If a token is present in the underlying REST session object, Imperative uses the token for authentication.
- CLI help text includes new options such as `tokenValue`. Plug-in developers might need to update mismatched snapshots in automated tests.
- Updated the version of TypeScript from v3.7.4 to v3.8.0.
- Updated the version of TSLint from v5.x to v6.1.2.
- Update log4js to improve Webpack compatibility for extenders.

#### Zowe Explorer

The following features and enhancements were added to **Zowe Explorer**:

* Added a credentials check feature that allows users to update their credentials if they receive an authorization error.
* Added a star icon that clearly denotes data sets, USS files, and jobs as favorites.
* Added a profile validation feature that checks whether a profile is valid. The feature is triggered when any action is performed with the profile. Validated profiles are indicated by a green mark.
* Disallowed case sensitivity for profiles with same names.
* Enabled editing of search filters.
* Enabled editing of ASCII files in USS.
* Improved text in confirmation dialogs.
* Reorganized the Data Sets context menu to match the order of commands recommended by VSCode.

### Bug fixes

The following bugs were fixed.

#### ZSS

- Bugfix: ICFS error message is not printed. In this version, the issue has been resolved [#143](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/143)

#### Zowe App Server

- Bugfix: Changing editor syntax in the MVS explorer caused a callstack limit exception. This was due to a trap focus conflict between the Orion editor and the modal part within the ui Select component on syntax change. In this version, the issue has been resolved by disabling `disableEnforceFocus` for the syntax selector [#129](https://github.com/zowe/explorer-mvs/pull/129)
- Bugfix: An Infinite Auth loop would occur on explorer apps due to APIML and z/OSMF auth timeouts mismatch. In this version, the issue has been resolved by adding a force login flag if a datasets request comes back as 401 [#124](https://github.com/zowe/explorer-mvs/pull/124)
- Bugfix: When using the JES Explorer to view Spool files of a job, users cannot open a spool file that has the same name as one already open. This issue has been resolved by adding a unique id to content tabs to allow opening of overlapping names [#188](https://github.com/zowe/explorer-jes/pull/188)
- Bugfix: The `Env var` for `TERM` gets set to "linux", which is not recognized by USS. This issue has been resolved through the removal of rxjs-compat [#29](https://github.com/zowe/vt-ng2/pull/29)
- Bugfix: NGX-monaco-editor library has been removed in order to fix a bug. This now allows the Editor to open and view files after the second instance of opening them [#155](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-editor/pull/155)
  - Removed use of node-sass, so that native compilation is not required
  - Updated to typescript 3.7 from version 2.7.2
  - Updated to monaco 0.20 from version 0.13. The monaco changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
#### Zowe CLI

- Fixed an issue where CLI web help failed to load in Internet Explorer 11. [#393](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/393).
- Fixed an issue where the `--help-web` option did not function on macOS when the `DISPLAY` environment variable was undefined. [#322](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/322).
- Updated Imperative version to include security fixes.
- Updated Imperative version to fix a problem where users could not use a service profile after storing a token in a base profile.
- Fixed an issue where optional secure fields were not deleted when overwriting a profile.

## Version 1.12.0 LTS (June 2020)

### New features and enhancements

The following features and enhancements were added.

#### Zowe installation
- Keystore directory generation updated to add new parameters. If you wish to enable SSO for the desktop you need to rerun the `zowe-setup-certificates.sh` script during the upgrade process, with new values in the `zowe-setup-certificates.env` file. [#1347](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1347) / Doc: [#1162](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/issues/1162)
- Added a `-l` optional parameter to the `zowe-support.sh` script. This parameter allows you to specify the custom log directory used in installation and configuration when collecting support data. [#1322](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1322) / Doc: [#1165](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/issues/1165)
- Added the validate only mode of Zowe. This allows you to check whether all the component validation checks of the Zowe installation pass without starting any of the components. [#1335](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1335) / Doc: [#1181](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/pull/1181)
- Separated ZSS component from the Zowe App Server component. [#1320](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1320)
- Introduced z/OSMF Workflows that accomplish the following Zowe installation and configuration tasks:
  - Install Zowe runtime using z/OSMF Workflows.
  - Configure z/OS Security Manager.
  - Configure Zowe certificates.
  - Create and configure the Zowe instance directory, and run the Zowe started task.

#### API Mediation Layer

- Provided Zowe Authentication and Authorization Service (ZAAS) client.
- Refreshed the static client definitions from the API Catalog UI.
- Switched to `sso-auth` instead of `apiml-auth`.

- Fixed the order of fetching the JWT from a request.
- Implemented request retrying for service instances.

#### ZSS

- ZSS now follows the Zowe Component scheme, as part of the DESKTOP component group [#177](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/177)
- Read JWT token information from environment variables, if they exist, to further support SSO during a standard installation. [#178](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/178)
- In previous versions, ZIS did not use the version information provided in `zss/version.txt`. In this version, the ZIS build uses `version.txt` the same way that ZSS uses it. [#184](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/184)

#### Zowe App Server

- Added SSO token name and label to `convert-env.sh` for use with ZSS. [#118](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/118)
- Script has been updated to allow ZSS to be a separate component. [#117](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/117)
- The app-server will favor and use a SAF keyring if defined for use in Zowe, rather than a unix file for keys, certificates, and certificate authorities. [#116](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/116)
- The process for making bundled plugins using `ROOT_DIR` has been upgraded [#123](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/123)
- Updates have been implemented for modal keyboard accessibility. [#148](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-editor/pull/148):
  - Editor now has keyboard navigation in the browsing tree and pop-up modals.
  - Pop-ups can be traversed with Tab/Tab + Shift.
- Desktop redesign suite and personalization settings have been implemented. [#221](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-manager/pull/221)
- Right-click context menus have been implemented for the new desktop style. [#216](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-manager/pull/216)
- A new attribute has been implemented to load plugins from different relative paths. [#212](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/212)

#### Zowe CLI

- Added the `zowe files hrec ds` command to recall data sets. [#556](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/556)
- Made the `account` option optional in TSO profiles. [#709](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/709)
- Made `user` and `host` options optional in SSH profiles. [#709](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/709)

The following features and enhancements were added to the **z/OS FTP Plug-in for Zowe CLI**:

- Added the `zowe zos-ftp list data-set-members` command to find members in a PDS. [#45](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-ftp-plugin/issues/45)

You can install the latest version of the extension from the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zowe.vscode-extension-for-zowe).

### Bug fixes

The following bugs were fixed.

#### Zowe installation
-  Minor enhancements to add log directory validation and remove unnecessary log file splitting. [#1334](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1334), [#1300](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/issues/1300)
- When the automatically detected hostname that Zowe is installed on cannot be resolved, use the IP address instead. This covers the scenario when the USS `hostname` command returned a system name that wasn't externally addressable. [#1279](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1279)
- Fixed an issue that could cause an upgraded version of Zowe to try and use an old version of plug-ins, by switching the desktop to use a relative reference to find plugins. [#1326](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1362)

#### ZSS

- Bugfix: Fixed a segfault when no config file is provided by moving all the zowelog invocations to a location where the logging environment is ready. Additionally, cleanup logic has been
introduced to ensure that we free the STC base resources before leaving main. [#187](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/187)
- Bugfix: In previous versions, if a warning message is produced by the compiler, the build process is considered successful. This is often dangerous as warnings can indicate passing the wrong type or redefinition of a `#define`, which should be considered bugs. The following changes have been implemented to make the build process more strict [#188](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/188):
  - Make sure there are no warning messages in the current build.
    - Update deps to remove the `httpfileservice.c` warning message, and pick up a minor type fix.
    - Ensure side-deck `file/SYSDEFSD DD` by adding the `dll` option to the linker.
  - Adjust the compiler env variable that controls the severity.
  - Ensure no ZSS binary is created if RC != 0.

#### Zowe App Server

- Bugfix: Logout of sso-auth was not working because it was expecting apiml parameters that should have been there but were controlled by the env var APIML_ENABLE_SSO. In this version, the issue has been resolved. [#126](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/126)
- Bugfix: In this release, many bugs picked up by the Sonar scan for core Zowe repositories have been resolved [#214](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/214/)
- Bugfix: Plugin api would not respond if a plugin could not load due to a dependency not being met. That plugin would not be placed in the array that checks when the processing has finished, so a response would never be generated. [#208](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/208)
- Bugfix: Fixed a logout cookie bug and sso-auth behavior bug in order to fully support SSO.
Additionally, `tokenInjector` was removed as it is no longer required with the introduction of SSO. [#209](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/209)
- Bugfix: Fixed lease information for API ML [#218](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/218)
- Bugfix: In previous versions, the user was never shown the logout screen when the plugin would detect zss, but not apiml. In this version, this issue has been resolved. [#221](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/221)
- Bugfix: Fixed issue where localhost & 127.0.0.1 were always used even when not true. Additionally, each worker in the cluster attempted registration even though, from an outside perspective, it is 1 server. In this version, the server uses a real hostname and tries to find the ip that best matches what apiml would be able to use [#203](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/203)

#### Zowe CLI

#### Zowe CLI

To leverage the new features and plug-ins available in this version, you must follow the steps in [Migrating to the LTS version](../user-guide/cli-updatingcli.md#migrating-to-long-term-support-lts-version).

The following new CLI plug-ins are added:

  - [IBM® z/OS FTP Plug-in for Zowe CLI](./../user-guide/cli-ftpplugin.md)
  - [IBM® IMS™ Plug-in for Zowe CLI](./../user-guide/cli-imsplugin.md)
  - [IBM® MQ Plug-in for Zowe CLI](./../user-guide/cli-mqplugin.md)
  - [Secure Credential Store for Zowe CLI](./../user-guide/cli-scsplugin.md)

The following new features and enhancements are added in this version:

- **Notable Change:** The `zowe zos-files download ds` and `zowe zos-files download uf` commands no longer put the full content in the response format json (`--rfj`) output. [More information.](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/331)

- **Notable Change:** The `--pass` option is changed to `--password`  for all commands and profiles (zosmf, cics, etc...). The aliases `--pw` and `--pass` still function. To update a profile, issue the `zowe profiles update` command and use the new option name `--password`.

- **Notable Change:** You can enter `PROMPT*` as a value for any CLI option to enable interactive prompting. If you wrote scripts in which any option is defined with the exact value `PROMPT*`, the script will not execute properly in this version. For more information, see [Using the prompt for sensitive options](./../user-guide/cli-usingcli.md#using-the-prompt-feature).

- Zowe CLI was tested and confirmed to run on Unix System Services (USS) on z/OS. For more information, refer to  blog [Installing Node.js on the Mainframe](https://medium.com/@plape/installing-node-js-on-the-mainframe-both-linux-and-z-os-to-run-zowe-cli-19abb6494e41).

    (The IBM Db2 and Secure Credential Store plug-ins for Zowe CLI will *not* run on z/OS due to native code requirements.)

- The `zowe files copy` command was added for copying the contents of a data set or member to another data set or member. [#580](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/580)

- Zowe CLI now exploits Node.js stream APIs for download and upload of spool files, data sets, and USS files. [(#331)](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/331)

- The following new commands were added for interacting with file systems:
    - `zowe zos-files list fs` [#429](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/429)
    - `zowe zos-files mount fs` [#431](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/431)
    - `zowe zos-files unmount fs` [#432](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/432)

- The following new commands were added for creating USS files and directories:
    - `zowe zos-files create file` [#368](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/368)
    - `zowe zos-files create dir` [#368](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/368)

The IBM® CICS® Plug-in is updated with the following functionality:

  - **Notable Change:** The plug-in now uses HTTPS by default when connecting to CMCI. The option `--protocol http` was added to let you override the default as needed. [#77](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-cics-plugin/issues/77)

  -  Define, enable, install, discard, disable, and delete CICS URIMaps. [#53](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-cics-plugin/issues/53) [#49](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-cics-plugin/issues/49) [#48](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-cics-plugin/issues/48) [#51](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-cics-plugin/issues/51) [#50](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-cics-plugin/issues/50) [#52](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-cics-plugin/issues/52)

## Version 1.8.0 (February 2020)

### New features and enhancements

The following features and enhancements were added.

#### Installation of Zowe z/OS components

- The installation now just needs two parameters configured: the USS location of the runtime directory and a data set prefix where a SAMPLIB and LOADLIB will be created.  The runtime directory permissions are set to 755 and when Zowe is run, no data is written to the runtime directory.
- The way to configure Zowe is changed. Previously, you configured Zowe at installation time with the `zowe-install.yaml` file.  This file has been removed and is no longer used in this release.
- A new directory `zowe-instance-dir` has been introduced that contains configuration data used to launch Zowe.  This allows more than one Zowe instance to be started from the same Zowe runtime directory.  A new file `instance.env` within each `zowe-instance-dir` directory controls which ports are allocated to the Zowe servers as well as location of any dependencies such as Java, z/OSMF or node.  No configuration data is specified at install time.  The data is only read, validated and used at launch time.  The `instance.env` file contains a parameter value `LAUNCH_COMPONENT_GROUPS` that allows you to control which Zowe subsystems to launch, for example you can run the Zowe desktop and not the API Mediation Layer, or vice-versa; you can run just the API Mediation Layer and not the Zowe desktop.   The `zowe-instance-dir` directory is also where log files are collected.  Static extensions to the API Mediation Layer are recorded in the Zowe instance directory as well as any plug-in extensions to the Zowe desktop.  This allows the runtime directory to be fully replaced during PTF upgrades or moving to later Zowe releases while preserving configuration data and extension definitions that are held in the instance directory.
- A new directory `keystore-directory` has been introduced outside of the Zowe runtime directory which is where the Zowe certificate is held, as well as the truststore for public certificates from z/OS services that Zowe communicates to (such as z/OSMF).  A keystore directory can be shared between multiple Zowe instances and across multiple Zowe runtimes.
- All configuration of z/OS security that was done by Unix shell scripts during installation and configuration has been removed.  A JCL member `ZWESECUR` is provided that contains all of the JCL needed to configure permissions, user IDs and groups, and other steps to prepare and configure a z/OS environment to successfully run Zowe.  Code is included for RACF, Top Secret, and ACF/2.
- The Zowe cross memory server installation script `zowe-install-apf-server.sh` is removed.  In this release, the steps for configuring z/OS security are included in the `ZWESECUR` JCL member.
- Previously, Zowe runs its two started tasks under the user ID of `IZUSVR` and admin of `IZUADMIN`.  These belong to z/OSMF and are no longer used in this release. Instead, Zowe includes two new user IDs of `ZWESVUSR` (for the main Zowe started task), `ZWESIUSR` (for the cross memory server), and `ZWEADMIN` as a group.  These user IDs are defaults and different ones can be used depending on site preferences.
- Previously, the main Zowe started task is called `ZOWESVR`. Now it is called `ZWESVSTC`.
- Previously, the cross memory started task is called `ZWESIS01`. Now it is called `ZWESISTC`.
- The script `zowe-verify.sh` is no longer included with Zowe. Now the verification is done at launch time and dependent on the launch configuration parameters. It is no longer done with a generic script function that `zowe-verify.sh` used to provide.

For more information about how to install Zowe z/OS components, see [Installation roadmap](../user-guide/install-zos.md).

#### API Mediation Layer
- The API Catalog backend has been modified to support the OpenAPI 3.0 version. The API Catalog now supports the display of API documentation in the OpenAPI 3.0 format.

- A new Eureka metadata definition has been developed to enable service registration that does not require using existing pre-prepared enablers. Both new and old metadata versions are supported by the Discovery Service. Corresponding documentation to onboard a service with the Zowe API ML without an onboarding enabler has also been refactored.

- The plain Java enabler has been redesigned for simple and straight-forward API service configuration. Configuration parameters have been refactored to remove duplicates and unused parameters, and improve consistency with other parameters. Documentation to Onboard a REST API service with the Plain Java Enabler (PJE) has also been refactored.


#### Zowe App Server
- The app server now issues a message indicating it is ready, how many plug-ins loaded, and where it can be accessed from [#355](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/issues/355)
- Restructured the App server directories to separate writable configuration items from read-only install content [#911](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/911) [#627](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/issues/627) [#87](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/87) [#43](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-build/pull/43)
- Move install-app script to instance directory bin folder for ease of use [#966](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/966)
- Access control for app visibility [216](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/issues/216)

    - Editor fix: Disable text area for datasets in the absence of write ability [#342](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/issues/342)
    - Editor fix: When saving a new file use the opened directory in the dialog [#233](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/issues/233)

#### Zowe CLI

- The Zowe CLI REST API now supports the following capabilities for managing data sets:
  - Rename sequential and partitioned data sets. [#571](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/571)
  - Migrate data sets. [#558](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/558)
  - Copy data sets to another data set and copy members to another member. [#578](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/578)
- The Zowe CLI REST API now supports HTTP ETags in response data. The ETag mechanism allows client applications to cache data more efficiently. ETAgs can also prevent simultaneous, conflicting updates to a resource. [#598](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/598)

## Version 1.7.1 (December 2019)

### New features and enhancements

The following features and enhancements were added.

#### Zowe App Server

- A backup routine for when a non-administrator tries to access the API. Instead of executing privileged commands and failing, it will execute a command to get their profile, and return only the information in their scope.

([#114](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/114))

- The ability to retrieve profiles only by prefix. This can be done by looking for a profile with a "." at the end. This will act as a wildcard which extracts everything matching that prefix. ([#114](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/114))

#### Zowe SMP/E installation

The pre-release of the Zowe SMP/E build is updated to be based on Zowe Version 1.7.1.

The first implementation is a manager of Java servlet type dataservices, where the App Server manages Tomcat instances when Tomcat is present. ([#158](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/issues/158))
- Added a tomcat xml configuration file with substitutions for values (ports, keys, certificates) necessary for the App Server to manage one or more instances of Tomcat for hosting servlet dataservices. Also added a new section to the zluxserver.json file to describe dataservice providers such as the aforementioned Tomcat Java Servlet one. (#49)
- Added Swagger API documentation support. Application developers can include a Swagger 2.0 JSON or YAML file in the app's /doc/swagger directory for each REST data service. Each file must have the same name as the data service. Developers can then reference the files at runtime using a new app route: /ZLUX/plugins/PLUGINID/catalogs/swagger. They can reference individual services at: /ZLUX/plugins/PLUGINID/catalogs/swagger/SERVICENAME. If swagger documents are not present, the server will use contextual knowledge to show some default values. ([#159](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/issues/159))
- The following new REST and cross-memory services have been added ([#32](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/32)):

If you have zosmf profiles that you created prior to January 11, 2019, you must recreate them to use the `--password` option. The aliases `--pw` and `--pass` still function when you issue commands as they did prior to this breaking change. You do not need to modify scripts that use  `--pass`.

- The `@next` npm tag used to install Zowe CLI is deprecated. Use the `@latest` npm tag to install the product with the online registry method.

### What's new in the Zowe Desktop

- You can now obtain information about an application by right-clicking on an application icon and then clicking **Properties**.

- To view version information for the desktop, click the avatar in the lower right corner of the desktop.

- Multiple instances of the same application can be opened and tracked from the launchbar. To open multiple instances, right-click and choose **Open New**.
Once multiple instances are open, you can click the application icon to select which application to bring to the foreground. The number of orbs below the application icon relates to the number of instances of the application that is open.

- Desktop framework logging trimmed and formalized to the Zowe App Logger. For more information, see [https://github.com/zowe/zlux/wiki/Logging](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/wiki/Logging).

- The UriBroker was updated to support dataservice versioning and UNIX file API updates.

- Removed error messages about missing `components.js` by making this optional component explicitly declared within an application. By using the property "webContent.hasComponents = true/false".

- Fixed a bug where the desktop might not load on high latency networks.

### What's new in the Zowe App Server

- HTTP support was disabled in favor of HTTPS-only hosting.

- The server can be configured to bind to specific IPs or to hostnames. Previously, the server would listen on all interfaces. For more information, see [https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/30](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/30).

- The core logger prefixes for the Zowe App Server were changed from "_unp" to "_zsf".

- Dataservices are now versioned, and dataservices can depend on specific versions of other dataservices. A plug-in can include more than one version of a dataservice for compatibility. For more information, see [https://github.com/zowe/zlux/wiki/ZLUX-Dataservices](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/wiki/ZLUX-Dataservices).

- Support to communicate with the API Mediation Layer with the use of keys and certificates was added.

- Fixed the `nodeCluster.sh` script to have its logging and environment variable behavior consistent with `nodeServer.sh`.

- Removed the "swaggerui" plug-in in favor of the API Catalog.

- Bugfix for `/plugins` API to not show the installation location of the plug-in.

- Bugfix to print a warning if the server finds two plug-ins with the same name.

- Added the ability to conditionally add HTTP headers for secure services to instruct the browser not to cache the responses. For more information, see [https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/issues/36](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/issues/36).

- Added a startup check to confirm that ZSS is running as a prerequisite of the Zowe App Server.

- Bugfix for sending HTTP 404 response when content is missing, instead of a request hanging.

- Added tracing of login, logout, and HTTP routing so that administrators can track access.

### What's changed

- Previously,  APIs for z/OS Jobs services and z/OS Data Set services are provided sing an IBM WebSphere Liberty web application server. In this release, they are provided using a Tomcat web application server. You can view the associated API documentation corresponding to the z/OS services through the API Catalog.

- References to `zlux-example-server` were changed to `zlux-app-server` and references to `zlux-proxy-server` were changed to `zlux-server-framework`.

### Known issues

**Paste operations from the Zowe Desktop TN3270 and VT Terminal applications**

**TN3270 App** - If you are using Firefox, the option to use Ctrl+V to paste is not available. Instead, press Shift + right-click to access the paste option through the context menu.

Pressing Ctrl+V will perform paste for the TN3270 App on other browsers.

**VT Terminal App** - In the VT Terminal App, Ctrl+V will not perform a paste operation for any browser.

**Note:** In both terminals, press Shift + right-click to access copy and paste options through the context menu.

**z/OS Subsystems App** - The z/OS Subsystems application is being removed temporarily for the 1.0 release.  The reason is that as the ZSS has transitioned from closed to open source some APIs needed to be re-worked and are not complete yet.  Look for the return of the application in a future update.
