<details className="zowe-faq">

<summary></summary>

Zowe technology can be used by a variety of mainframe IT and non-IT professionals. The target audience is primarily application developers and system programmers, but the Zowe Application Framework is the basis for developing web browser interactions with z/OS that can be used by anyone.

</details>

### What language is Zowe written in?

<details className="zowe-faq">

<summary></summary>

Zowe consists of several components. The primary languages are Java and JavaScript. Zowe CLI and Desktop are written in TypeScript. ZSS is written in C, while the cross memory server is written in metal C.

The Open Mainframe Project wants to encourage adoption and innovation, and also let the community share new source code across the Zowe ecosystem. The open source code can be used by anyone, provided that they adhere to the licensing terms.

</details>


### What are some examples of how Zowe technology might be used by z/OS products and applications?

<details className="zowe-faq">

<summary></summary>

The Zowe Desktop (web user interface) can be used in many ways, such as to provide custom graphical dashboards that monitor data for z/OS products and applications.

Zowe CLI can also be used in many ways, such as for simple job submission, data set manipulation, or for writing complex scripts for use in mainframe-based DevOps pipelines.

The increased capabilities of RESTful APIs on z/OS allows APIs to be used in programmable ways to interact with z/OS services.

</details>


### What is the best way to get started with Zowe?

<details className="zowe-faq">

<summary></summary>

Zowe provides a convenience build that includes the components released-to-date, as well as IP being considered for contribution, in an easy to install package on [Zowe.org](https://zowe.org). The convenience build can be easily installed and the Zowe capabilities seen in action.

To install the complete Zowe solution, see [Installing Zowe](../user-guide/installandconfig.md).

To get up and running with the Zowe CLI component quickly, see [Zowe CLI quick start](cli-getting-started.md).

</details>


### What are the prerequisites for Zowe?

<details className="zowe-faq">

<summary></summary>

Prerequisites vary by component used, but in most cases the primary prerequisites are Java and NodeJS on z/OS and the z/OS Management Facility enabled and configured. For a complete list of software requirements listed by component, see [System requirements for z/OS components](../user-guide/systemrequirements-zos.md) and [System requirements for Zowe CLI](../user-guide/systemrequirements-cli.md).

</details>

### What's the difference between using Zowe with or without Docker?  

<Badge text="Technical Preview"/>

<details className="zowe-faq">

<summary></summary>

Docker is a download option for Zowe that allows you to run certain Zowe server components outside of z/OS.
The Docker image contains the Zowe components that do not have the requirement of having to run on z/OS: The App server, API Mediation Layer, and the USS/MVS/JES Explorers.

Configurating components with Docker is similar to the procedures you would follow without Docker, however tasks such as installation and running with Docker are a bit different, as these tasks become Linux oriented, rather than utilizing Jobs and STCs.

**NOTE:** z/OS is still required when using the Docker image. Depending on which components of Zowe you use, you'll still need to set up z/OS Management Facility as well as Zowe's ZSS and Cross memory servers.

</details>

### Is the Zowe CLI packaged within the Zowe Docker download?  

<Badge text="Technical Preview"/>

<details className="zowe-faq">

<summary></summary>

At this time, the Docker image referred to in this documentation contains only Zowe server components. It is possible to make a Docker image that contains the Zowe CLI, so additional Zowe content, such as the CLI, may have Docker as a distribution option later. 

If you are interested in improvements such as this one, please be sure to express that interest to the Zowe community!

</details>

### Does ZOWE support z/OS ZIIP processors?

<details className="zowe-faq">

<summary></summary>

Only the parts of Zowe that involve Java code are ZIIP enabled. The API Mediation Layer composed of the API Gateway, Discovery and Catalog servers along with any Java-based services that work with them such as the Jobs and Datasets servers are ZIIP enabled. Also, the CLI and VSCode Explorer make large use of z/OSMF, which is Java so they are ZIIP enabled as well. More details on portions of Zowe which are Java (ZIIP) enabled can be found [here](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/getting-started/zowe-architecture#zowe-architecture).

This leaves C and NodeJS code which are not ZIIP enabled, BUT, we have a [tech preview](https://www.zowe.org/download.html) available currently that allows execution of Java as well as NodeJS code, on Linux or zLinux via Docker. With the tech preview, only the C code remains on z/OS, which is not ZIIP enabled.

</details>

### How is access security managed on z/OS?

<details className="zowe-faq">

<summary></summary>

## Zowe CLI FAQ

### Why might I use Zowe CLI versus a traditional ISPF interface to perform mainframe tasks?

<details className="zowe-faq">

<summary></summary>

For developers new to the mainframe, command-line interfaces might be more familiar than an ISPF interface. Zowe CLI lets developers be productive from day-one by using familiar tools. Zowe CLI also lets developers write scripts that automate a sequence of mainframe actions. The scripts can then be executed from off-platform automation tools such as Jenkins automation server, or manually during development.

</details>


### With what tools is Zowe CLI compatible?

<details className="zowe-faq">

<summary></summary>

Zowe CLI is very flexible; developers can integrate with modern tools that work best for them. It can work in conjunction with popular build and testing tools such as Gulp, Gradle, Mocha, and Junit. Zowe CLI runs on a variety of operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Zowe CLI scripts can be abstracted into automation tools such as Jenkins and TravisCI.
