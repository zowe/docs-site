Review this article for steps that enable single sign on via Personal Access Tokens. 

## Prerequisite using the Caching Service

To enable Personal Access Token support when using the Caching Service, **Infinispan** is the required storage solution. Infinispan is part of Zowe installation. No additional software or installation is required when using this storage solution.

To enable this storage method, set the value of `zowe.components.caching-service.storage.mode` to `infinispan` in the `zowe.yaml` configuration file. Infinispan environment variables are not currently following the v2 naming convention, so they must be defined into `zowe.environments` section.  For more information on these properties and their values see [Infinispan configuration](../../extend/extend-apiml/api-mediation-infinispan.md#infinispan-configuration).


  ``` yaml
  zowe
    components:
          caching-service:
            storage:
              mode: infinispan
              infinispan: 
                jgroups:
                  port: 7098
  ```

## Enabling Personal Access Tokens

Use the following procedure to enable Personal Access Tokens.

1. Open the file `zowe.yaml`.
2. Find or add the property with the value `components.gateway.apiml.security.personalAccessToken.enabled: true`.
3. Restart Zowe.
