## New features and enhancements

Zowe Version 2.18.2 contains the enhancements that are described in the following topics:

### Zowe Application Framework

- An enhancement is added to the TN3270 emulator. Before adding the enhancement, TN3270 used CCSID 37 to encode characters while communicating with the mainframe host. After adding the enhancement, the TN3270 emulator can use CCSIDs such as 037, 273, 275, 277, 278, 280, 284, 285, 297, 424, 437, 500, 870, 871, 875, 924, 1025, 1047, 1140, 1141, 1142, 1143,1144, 1145, 1146, 1147, and 1148. This enhancement introduces a wider range of character encoding schemes to handle different languages and character sets, and the system can correctly interpret the characters without errors or misrepresentation. ([#]())

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

- A Java sample app has been added to assist users to authenticate client certificates. ([#4009](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4009))
- Users can now configure the connect and read timeout for Eureka HTTP client. ([#4046](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4046))
- Java 21 is now supported. ([#4027](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4027))

## Bug fixes

Zowe Version 2.18.2 contains the bug fixes that are described in the following topics:

### Server Install

- Fixed an issue of the API Catalog by introduced a workaround. Before the fix, the API Catalog attempted to establish two secure Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections while the API Catalog operated under AT-TLS. Since AT-TLS already handled the secure communication, the attempt by the API Catalog was unnecessary and led to performance overheads or failures in communication. After the fix, the registration information of the API Catalog updates in the Eureka client system to indicate to other systems that AT-TLS is in use and provides secure communication. This ensures that the API Catalog and other services interacting with it recognize the existing secure environment that AT-TLS provides and avoid unnecessary security processing. ([#609](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/609))

### Zowe Application Framework

- Fixed an issue where the HTTP client software was unable to handle `EWOULDBLOCK` errors while processing data from AT-TLS in Zowe. The fix introduced `HTTP_CLIENT_UNBLOCKED_TRY_AGAIN (19)` and `HTTP_CLIENT_SOCKET_TIMEOUT (20)` error codes into the HTTP client software to enable the HTTP client software to handle the `EWOULDBLOCK` errors with greater efficiency. ([#534](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/534))

### ZSS

- Fixed an issue where there was a delay in response from the Gateway after HTTP or AT-TLS contacted the Gateway for Single Sign On(SSO). After the fix, if HTTP or AT-TLS contact the Gateway for SSO, the Gateway provides an immediate response. ([#775](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/775)), ([#772](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/772))
- Fixed an issue where Zowe, which was installed on the zOS operating system, stopped working because that version of zOS changed or upgraded. After the fix, Zowe continues to work uninterrupted even if the version of the underlying zOS changes or upgrades. ([#780](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/780))

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

- Added HSTS header when AT-TLS enabled for V2. ([#4071](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4071))
- Changed error code SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE to INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR when ticket generation fails. ([#4043](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/4043))

### Zowe CLI

#### DB2 Plug-in for Zowe CLI

- Updated `tar-fs` transitive dependency to resolve technical debt. ([#177](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-db2-plugin/pull/177))

- Updated `axios` transitive dependency to resolve technical debt. ([#175](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-db2-plugin/pull/175))
