## Bug fixes

Zowe Version 2.18.1 contains the bug fixes that are described in the following topics:

### Server Install

- Fixed an issue such that while logging the `zwe` command, sometimes the log file had a wrong tag and the file was unreadable. ([#4071](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4071))
- Fixed an issue such that after you specified the `--log-dir` parameter type as a file applied to the `zwe` command, the `InternalError: stack overflow` error occured. ([#4064](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4064))
- Fixed an issue of the Error message `ZWEL0141E`. Error message now print a user ID. ([#3971](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/3971))


### Application Framework

- Fixed an issue where the app-server caused Zowe to print "FSUM7422 node is not found" and "Node found in NODE_HOME" upon startup. This avoids confusion about whether the node requirements are met. ([#324](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/324))
- Fixed an issue where it was not possible to configure the app-server as the configuration property `components.app-server.node.mediationLayer.eureka` was not documented in the schema. ([#336](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/336))
- Fixed an issue where the app-server could not register with the discovery server after AT-TLS was enabled for the app-server. ([#581](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/581))
- Fixed an issue that prevented the Desktop from selecting the most efficient route to access ZSS. After the fix, the Desktop has the necessary information to identify and use a direct route to access ZSS. ([#589](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/589))
- Fixed an issue where troubleshooting information was unavailable when there was a network failure during the eureka registration process. The `components.app-server.node.mediationLayer.traceTls` property was introduced to troubleshoot TLS issues. The property can trace the connection the app-server forms with the discovery server, revealing the cause of low-level networking issues. ([#591](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/591))


### ZSS

- Fixed an issue where the support for the cross-memory server failed if the number of parameters were more than 128. ([#684](https://github.com/zowe/zss/issues/684))
- Fixed an issue where the ZSS package was not accessible from the Gateway when AT-TLS was used. ([#748](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/748))
- Fixed an issue where the support line broke after the number of parameter values for the support cross-memory server exceeded the limit of 128-characters. Structures of the configuration cross-memory service server and the cross-memory server now extend to support parameter names over 72 characters and values over 128 characters, while maintaining backward compatibility. ([#684](https://github.com/zowe/zss/issues/684))
- Fixed an issue where the IARV64 results were not checked for 0x7FFFF000. ([#474](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/issues/474))
- Introduced an additional NULL check to fix an issue where SLH did not ABEND when MEMLIMIT was reached. ([#476])(https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/476)
- Fixed a leak in the `rsusermap` code. ([#467](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/issues/467))
- Fixed an issue so that the `HEAPPOOLS` and `HEAPPOOLS64` parameters no longer need to be set to `OFF` for configuration manager. ([#498](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/498))
- Fixed an issue so that `CEE3ERP` is invoked in LE 31-bit XPLINK. ([#503](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/503))
