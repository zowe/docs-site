## Bug fixes

Zowe Version 2.18.1 contains the bug fixes that are described in the following topics:

### Zowe Application Framework

#### Zlux App Manager

- Fixed an issue where the app-server caused Zowe to print "FSUM7422 node is not found" and "Node found in NODE_HOME" upon startup. This avoids confusion about whether the node requirements are met. ([#324](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-manager/pull/324))
- Fixed an issue where it was not possible to configure the app-server as the configuration property `components.app-server.node.mediationLayer.eureka` was not documented in the schema. ([#334](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-manager/pull/334))


#### Zlux Server Framework

- Fixed an issue where the app-server could not register with the discovery server after AT-TLS was enabled for the app-server. ([#581](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/581))

- Fixed an issue that prevented the Desktop from selecting the most efficient route to access ZSS.
After the fix, the Desktop has the necessary information to identify and use a direct route to access ZSS. ([#589](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/589))

- Fixed an issue where troubleshooting information was unavailable when there was a network failure during the eureka registration process. After this fix, the `components.app-server.node.mediationLayer.traceTls` property was introduced to troubleshoot TLS issues. The property can trace the connection the app-server forms with the discovery server, revealing the cause of low-level networking issues. ([#591](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/591))


#### Zowe Common C 
- Fixed an issue where the IARV64 results were not checked for 0x7FFFF000. ([#474](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/issues/474))
- Fixed an issue where SLH did not ABEND when MEMLIMIT was reached. (additional NULL check)
- Fixed a leak in the rsusermap code. ([#467](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/issues/467))
- Fixed an issue where the support line broke because the number of parameter values of the support cross-memory server were more than the current limit of 128 symbols. After this fix, the structures of the config cross-memory service server and the cross-memory server are extended. The structures are store the parameters to support parameter names and values longer than 72 and 128 characters respectively. Backward compatibility is also provided.([#684](https://github.com/zowe/zss/issues/684))
- Fixed an issue so that the `HEAPPOOLS` and `HEAPPOOLS64` parameters no longer need to be set to `OFF` for configuration manager. ([#498](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/498))
- Fixed an issue so that `CEE3ERP` is invoked in LE 31-bit XPLINK, ([#503](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/503))


#### Zowe Install packaging
- Fixed an issue such that while logging the `zwe` command, sometimes the log file had a wrong tag and the file was unreadable. ([#4068](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4068))
- Fixed an issue such that for the `zwe` command, after you specified the `--log-dir` parameter type as a file, the `InternalError: stack overflow` error occured. ([#4063](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/4063))
- Fixed an issue of the Error message `ZWEL0141E`. Before the fix, the error message did not print a user ID. ([#3971](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/3971))


#### ZSS package
- Fixed an issue where the support for the cross-memory server failed if the number of parameters were more than 128. ([#684](https://github.com/zowe/zss/issues/684))
- Fixed an issue where the ZSS package was not accessible from the Gateway when AT-TLS was used. ([#748](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/748))

- Fixed an issue where the `ProfileInfo.profileManagerWillLoad` method failed if profiles were not yet read from disk. ([#2284](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2284))
