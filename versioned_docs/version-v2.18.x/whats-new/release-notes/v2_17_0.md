### Zowe installation and packaging

- Added `JCL` sample templates within `SZWESAMP` dataset, also seen within `“files/SZWESAMP”`. Datasets beginning with `ZWEI` are intended to be an alternative but not replacement of `zwe init` operations. `ZWEIRAC`, `ZWEITSS`, and `ZWEIACF` are derived from and intended to replace `ZWESECUR` in the future. `ZWEIKR*` are derived from and intended to replace `ZWEKRING` in the future. ([#3890](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/3890))
- Added a job, `ZWEGENER` within the `SZWESAMP` dataset. When provided the location of Zowe’s runtime directory and `YAML` files, this job will take the `SZWESAMP` sample JCL templates and resolve parameter values with those found in the `YAML` configuration after validation, placing the results into the `CUST.JCLLIB` dataset. This can be used to simplify setup of jobs for Zowe installation. ([#3890](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/3890))
- Startup performance has been improved by moving extension schema validation of application framework plugins from runtime to install time. This additionally helps identify schema errors at install time that would previously have been shown only at runtime. ([#3866](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/3866))
- Added `zowe.network.server.tls.attls` and `zowe.network.client.tls.attls` as Booleans for controlling global or per-component way to tell Zowe servers that they should operate in a mode compatible with an `AT-TLS` setup. ([#3463](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/3463))
- Startup performance has been improved by reducing the quantity of processes involved during startup. ([#115](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/115))
- Reduction in resource consumption. Each Zowe component uses one less shell process at runtime. ([#115](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/115))
- Added a “files/defaults.yaml” file which contains default `YAML` properties to reduce the chance of errors found during an upgrade of Zowe when re-using an older `YAML` configuration file. This file should not be edited but can be reviewed to learn default behaviors, and overridden within user `YAML` files. ([#3883](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/3883))

### Zowe Application Framework

#### Zlux App Server

- The `app-server` can now use Zowe's standardized and simplified `AT-TLS` configuration simply by toggling `zowe.network.server.tls.attls: true` or `components.app-server.zowe.network.server.tls.attls: true`. If you wish to control client tls separately from server `tls`, you can also use `zowe.network.client.tls.attls` or `components.app-server.zowe.network.client.tls.attls`. ([#300](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/300)) ([#303](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/303))
- Reduced startup time by removing a check for DNS behavior on node versions 14 and less. Node 14 has not been supported since September 2023. ([#304](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/304))
- Reduced startup time by consolidating startup configuration script actions into one process. ([#305](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/305))

#### Zlux Server Framework

- Added function `isClientAttls(zoweConfig)` within `libs/util.js.` whenever a plugin makes a network request, it should always use this to determine, if a normally `HTTPS` request should instead be made as `HTTP` due to `AT-TLS` handling the `TLS` when enabled. ([#544](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/544))

#### Zowe Common C

- Fixed `xplatform.loadFileUTF8` when trying to open `nonexistent` file. ([#454](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/454))
- Allocated `SLH` for `http server` with configurable value `httpRequestHeapMaxBlocks` in `YAML`. ([#447](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/447))

#### ZSS
- Added code to configure the `SLH` block size of the `http server` through `httpRequestHeapMaxBlocks` in the YAML. ([#701](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/701))

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

* Cloud gateway can now run with AT-TLS enabled in the environment. ([#3564](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3564))
* The request buffer size for WebSocket connections is now customizable. ([#3609](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3609))

### Zowe CLI

#### Zowe CLI (Core)

- Added the ability to set JCL reader properties for `--jobRecordLength`, `--jobRecordFormat`, and `--jobEncoding` on the `zowe jobs submit local-file` and `zowe jobs submit stdin` commands. ([#2139](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2139))
- Added the ability to download job spool files using other codepages with `--encoding` on the `zowe jobs download output`, `zowe jobs view spool-file-by-id`, and `zowe jobs view all-spool-content` commands. This allows users to download job spool files in other languages (i.e. IBM-1147 for French). ([#1822](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/1822))

#### Zowe CLI Imperative Framework

- Added the `ProfileInfo.profileManagerWillLoad` function to verify that the credential manager can load. ([#2111](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2111))
- Added support for proxy servers using a proxy http agent. Supports the usage of the environment variables HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY (not case sensitive).
  - If any of these environment variables is set, and depending on how the Zowe session is configured for http or https, the REST client instantiates an appropriate http agent.
  - If the z/OS system uses self-signed certificates then the proxy server must be configured to accept them.
  - If the proxy server itself is configured with self-signed certificates then the user needs to either import these certificates on their workstation, use `rejectUnauthorized` in their Zowe profile, or use the (not recommended) nodejs variable `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`.
  - Zowe also looks for the environment variable `NO_PROXY`. These work with a simple comma-separated list of hostnames that need to match with the hostname of the Zowe profile.

- Added the `BufferBuilder` utility class to provide a convenient way of downloading to a stream that can be read as a buffer. ([#2167](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2167))

## Bug fixes

Zowe Version 2.17.0 contains the bug fixes that are described in the following topics.

### Zowe installation and packaging
- Removed references to nonexistant STC `ZWESVSTC` from `z/OSMF` workflows. This was replaced with `ZWESLSTC` within `Zowe v2.x` and already existed within the workflows. ([#3881](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/3881))
- Updated messages `ZWEL0121E` and `ZWEL0122E` to clarify how to resolve these errors if encountered. ([#3884](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/3884))
- Fixed schema validation issue preventing startup when having null entries within the `zowe.certificates` section of the `YAML` configuration. ([#3905](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/3905)), ([#3901](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/3901))

### Zowe Application Framework

#### Zlux Server Framework

- Fixed function `isServerAttls(zoweConfig)` within `libs/util.js`, which was preventing using `AT-TLS` with `app-server`. ([#544](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/544))

#### Zowe Common C
- Fixed an incorrect check in the recovery router code, which might lead to the state `cell-pool` being released prematurely. ([#446](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/issues/446))

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

* Updated attls icsf condition. ([#3635](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3635))
* Added missing PAT documetantion. ([#3618](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3618))
* Added requestConnectionTimeout as a zowe.yaml property. ([#3629](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3629))
* Disabled auto conversion for tagged files on z/OS. ([#3619](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3619))
* The keystore is now not loaded when AT-TLS is set, thereby allowing ICSF keys. ([#3612](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3612))
* Health endpoints can now be optionally protected. ([#3625](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3625))
* The external URL in the ZUUL Gateway if AT-TLS is enabled has been corrected. ([#3565](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3565))
* The protocol in the start.sh is now specified. ([#3593](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3593))
* Fixed consistency between UI titles and messages.  ([#3502](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3502))
* WebSocket client default timeout is now customizable. ([#3613](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3613))
