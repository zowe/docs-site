# Onboarding from scratch

In this tutorial we consider how an organization with a product existing or under development with no pre-existing Rest API can be Onboarded to Zowe&trade;. This would then allow the product to be available from a central location and benefit from other Zowe API Mediation layer functionality. 

At this stage of your development you have more options and can design with Zowe in mind. 

As the example product we are using a simple Spring Boot sample app that can be downloaded here: [spring-boot-jzos-sample](https://github.com/zowe/spring-boot-jzos-sample)
