# Raising a Zowe Application Framework issue on GitHub

When necessary, you can raise GitHub issues against the Zowe&trade; zlux core repository [here](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/issues). This issue tracker is for the Desktop, the apps, and the app-server component. It is suggested that you use the template that best matches what you want to talk about.

If you need to open an issue about configmgr, ZSS, or ZIS you should instead open a ticket at the zss repository [here](https://github.com/zowe/zss/issues)

If you have a general server install & configuration issue, you should instead open a ticket in the community repository [here](https://github.com/zowe/community/issues)
