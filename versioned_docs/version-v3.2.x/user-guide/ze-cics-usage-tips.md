# Usage tips

Make the best use of the Zowe Explorer CICS Extension with the following tips.

## Multi-select functionality

Apply an action to multiple objects at the same time for increased efficiency. All menu action commands available when right-clicking a profile or resource (excluding **Show Attributes**) can be applied to multiple items. To do this, select the multiple nodes of the same type before right-clicking and selecting the command.

To select multiple nodes, hold the `Ctrl` or `Cmd` key while selecting the resources. You can also select multiple consecutive nodes by selecting the first item in a list of nodes and then holding the `Shift` key while selecting the last item in the list.

## Refreshing the resources view

Click the **Refresh** icon at the top of the **CICS** tree view to reload the resources in every region.
