# Benefits of team configuration

[Team configuration](../appendix/zowe-glossary#team-configuration) can make the initial setup of Zowe CLI more efficient by making service connection details easier to share and maintain within your organization.

Consider the following benefits of using team configuration for roles across your dev team:

- For a **team leader**, or Dev-Ops advocate, **sharing global team configurations** managed from one location, such as a software change management system. This allows multiple team members to use the same configurations stored in a repository or server.

- For a Dev-Ops advocate or **team leader**, quickly **onboarding new application developers** by sharing the configuration file that your team uses with the new team member.

- For an **application developer** in a small shop where you have the dual roles of application developer *and* a Dev-Ops advocate, having the **flexibility to create team or user configurations** that are most suitable for your needs.

- For a team member or **application developer**, efficiently managing **connection details in one location**.
