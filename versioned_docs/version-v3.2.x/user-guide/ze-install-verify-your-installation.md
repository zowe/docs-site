# Verifying your Zowe Explorer installation

Verify that Zowe Explorer has been installed successfully by searching data sets to test your connection to z/OSMF.

## Using your profile to search data sets

1. Expand **DATA SETS** in the **Side Bar**, and hover over the profile you want to filter.
2. Click the **Search** icon.
3. Use the **input box** field to enter your username and password when prompted.
4. Select the **+ Create a new filter** option.
5. Enter the criteria to filter search results.

    If Zowe Explorer is able to connect with z/OSMF and the user credentials are valid, the filtered data sets display in the **DATA SETS** tree view.

    If there is a problem with the z/OSMF connection and/or user credentials, an error displays. See [Troubleshooting Zowe Explorer](../troubleshoot/ze/troubleshoot-ze.md) for possible next steps.
