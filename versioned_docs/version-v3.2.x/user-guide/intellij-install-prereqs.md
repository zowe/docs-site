The plug-in is supported on all of the operating systems with GUI. To use the plug-in, you need to install an IntelliJ IDEA platform's IDE. The platform has a nubmer of IDEs for different purposes. E.g. if you have Java/Kotlin developers, there is an IntelliJ IDEA IDE, for Python developers, there is a PyCharm IDE, for web developers, there is a WebStorm IDE, etc.

There are two **Community** versions of the IDEs: **IntelliJ IDEA Community** and **PyCharm Community**. It means that these IDEs are open-source and free of charge. The plug-in is supported on any IntelliJ IDEA IDE, it is enough to have the **Community** version of any of the IDEs to work with the plug-in.
