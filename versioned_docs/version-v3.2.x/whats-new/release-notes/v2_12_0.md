### Zowe Application Framework 

#### Zlux App Server

- New versions of the components can change the location of their plug-ins, as the app-server will now re-inspect the plugin locations on each startup. ([#280](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/280))

#### ZLUX Server Framework

- Auth plug-ins that are not requested by any dataservice found at startup are no longer loaded by the server. ([#504](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/504))

#### ZSS

- ZSS now defaults to using `TLS 1.3`, which requires a minimum of zOS Version `2.4`. ([#646](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/646)) 
- Added configuration parameter `components.zss.agent.https.maxTls` to control which level of TLS to use, allowing downgrading to `tls 1.2` if desired with value `TLSv1.2`. ([#654]( https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/654))
- Added configuration parameter `components.zss.agent.https.trace` which can be set to `true` if desired to capture a `GSK` trace, which will be put into the log directory. ([#654]( https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/654))

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

* Added a Central API ML registry endpoint to the Cloud Gateway to access an aggregated view of all services from all domains. ([#3076](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3076))
* It is now possible to forward the client certificate from Central Gateway to Domain Gateway in the request header. ([#3046](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3046))
* You can now register the Gateway to an additional Discovery service. Clients outside of the API ML cluster can now know about other gateways to facilitate routing to clusters and domains. ([#3068](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3068) and [#3044](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3044))
* You can now verify service SSO support from API ML. ([#3054](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3054))
