### Zowe installation and packaging
* The code has been revised to return a Zowe configuration along with the information of the High Availability (HA) instance (if requested). After the enhancement, we get the correct information about if the component is enabled or disabled and more configuration details with the information of the requested HA instance. ([#3692](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/3692))

### Zowe Application Framework

#### Zlux App Server

* Updated schema to specify multiple discovery servers instead of juse one.([#290](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/290))

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

* Introduced a native identity mapper as a replacement for ZSS identity mapping of x509 and OIDC id. The native identity mapper removes a dependency on an external component and significantly improves performance by switching from an HTTP request to an in-memory call for certificate mapping. ([#3252](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3252))

## Bug fixes

Zowe Version 2.14.0 contains the bug fixes that are described in the following topics.

### Zowe installation and packaging
* Environment variables were not using the values specified for each High Availability (HA) instance when `zowe.useConfigmgr` was set to `true`. ([#3692](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/3692)) 

### Zowe Application Framework

#### Zlux Server Framework

* `App-server` could not load when multiple discovery servers were present and the App-server was unable to reach the first one specified. Now, the `App-server` will iterate through the list of servers until an accessible one is reached. ([#522](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/522))
* `App-server` would not correctly detect when it was running in a high-availability configuration environment. ([#521](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/521))
* A call to `GET /plugins` would trigger an authorization check regardless of if `rbac` was set `ON` or `OFF`.([#523](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/523))

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

* Fixed the truststore for websockets in the Spring Cloud Gateway (v2). ([#3249](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3249))
* Fixed the keyring path update to properly support keyring paths by Spring Cloud Gateway. ([#3265](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3265))
* Fixed a conflict of XML processing between EhCache and the onboarding process. ([#3266](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3266))
* Fixed using a keystore during creation of a request without a client certificate in Spring Cloud Gateway. ([#3273](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3273))
* Fixed closing WebSocket to prevent a memory leak. ([#3271](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3271))
* Fixed disabling EhCache. ([#3276](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3276))
* Fixed enabling CORS by default in AT-TLS mode used in the API Gateway. ([#3270](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3270))

### Zowe CLI

#### Zowe CLI (Core)

- Corrected the online help description for `zowe files compare uss`. ([#1754](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1754))
- Fixed typo in command help for `zowe zos-workflows create` commands. ([#2003](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2003))

#### Zowe CLI Imperative Framework

- Updated the error message shown for a command with a `null` or undefined option definition to include the command handler file path to better identify the command causing the error. ([#2002](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2002))

#### DB2 Plug-in for Zowe CLI
