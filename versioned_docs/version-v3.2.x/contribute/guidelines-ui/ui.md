# UI Guidelines
## Introduction

This style guide is the visual language that represents Zowe&trade;. It is a living document that will be updated based on the needs of our users and software requirements.

## Clear
Our users rely on our software to help them be efficient in their work. The interfaces and experiences that we design should be clear so that there is never confusion about where to click or how to take the next step. Users should always feel confident in their actions.

## Consistent
Users should be able to look at Zowe software products and know that they are in a family. Each software product is different, but should use similar patterns, icons, and interactions. If a user switches to a new product within Zowe, it should feel familiar.

## Smart
Our users are intelligent, and they need smart software. Zowe design patterns should always compliment the user’s intelligence and reflect the user’s complex work environment. Designs should align with the Zowe design language by putting the human needs of the user first.
