## How API ML transport security works

Security within the API Mediation Layer (API ML) is performed on several levels. This article describes how API ML uses Transport Layer Security (TLS). As a system administrator or API developer, use this guide to familiarize yourself with the following security concepts:

### Transport layer security

The TLS protocol should be used to ensure secure data-transport for all connections to API Mediation Layer services. While it is possible to disable the TLS protocol for debugging purposes or other use-cases, the enabled TLS protocol is the default mode.

### Authentication

Authentication is how an entity, whether it be a user (API Client), or an application (API Service), proves its true identity.

API ML uses the following authentication methods:

- **User ID and password**
    - The user ID and password are used to retrieve authentication tokens
    - Requests originate from a user
    - The user ID and password are validated by a z/OS security manager whereby
    a token is issued that is then used to access the API service

- **TLS client certificates**
    - Certificates are used for service-only requests

### Zowe API ML services

The following range of service types apply to the Zowe&trade; API ML:

- **Zowe API ML services**

  - **Gateway Service (GW)**  
    The Gateway is the access point for API clients that require access to API services.
    API services can be accessed through the Gateway by API Clients. The Gateway receives information about an API Service
    from the Discovery Service.

  - **Discovery Service (DS)**  
    The Discovery Service collects information about API services and provides this information to the Gateway
    and other services. API ML internal services also register to the Discovery Service.

  - **API Catalog (AC)**  
    The Catalog displays information about API services through a web UI. The Catalog receives information
    about an API service from the Discovery Service.

- **Authentication and Authorization Service (AAS)**  
    AAS provides authentication and authorization functionality to check user access to resources on z/OS.
    The API ML uses z/OSMF API for  authentication. 

- **API Clients**  
    API Clients are external applications, users, or other API services that access API services through the API Gateway

- **API Services**  
    API services are applications that are accessed through the API Gateway. API services register themselves to the
    Discovery Service and can access other services through the Gateway. If an API service is installed
    so that direct access is possible, API services can access other services without the Gateway.
    When APIs access other services, they can also function as API clients.

### Zowe API ML TLS requirements

The API ML TLS requires servers to provide HTTPS ports. Each API ML service has the following specific requirements:

- **API Client**
    - The API Client is not a server
    - Requires trust of the API Gateway
    - Has a truststore or SAF keyring that contains certificates required to trust the Gateway

- **Gateway Service**
    - Provides an HTTPS port
    - Has a keystore or SAF keyring with a server certificate
        - The certificate needs to be trusted by API Clients
        - This certificate should be trusted by web browsers because the API Gateway can be used to display web UIs
    - Has a truststore or SAF keyring that contains certificates needed to trust API Services

- **API Catalog**
    - Provides an HTTPS port
    - Has a keystore or SAF keyring with a server certificate
        - The certificate needs to be trusted by the API Gateway
        - This certificate does not need to be trusted by anyone else

- **Discovery Service**
    - Provides an HTTPS port
    - Has a keystore or SAF keyring with a server certificate
    - Has a truststore or SAF keyring that contains certificates needed to trust API services

- **API Service**
    - Provides an HTTPS port
    - Has a keystore or SAF keyring with a server and client certificate
        - The server certificate needs to be trusted by the Gateway
        - The client certificate needs to be trusted by the Discovery Service
        - The client and server certificates can be the same
        - These certificates do not need to be trusted by anyone else
    - Has a truststore or SAF keyring that contains one or more certificates that are required to trust the Gateway and Discovery Service

## Setting ciphers for API ML services

You can override ciphers that are used by the HTTPS servers in API ML services by configuring properties of the Gateway, Discovery Service, and API Catalog.

**Note:** You do not need to rebuild JAR files when you override the default values in shell scripts.

The *application.yml* file contains the default value for each service, and can be found [here](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/blob/master/gateway-service/src/main/resources/application.yml). The default configuration is packed in .jar files. On z/OS, you can override the default configuration in `<RUNTIME_DIR>/components/<APIML_COMPONENT>/bin/start.sh`.
Add the launch parameter of the shell script to set a cipher:

```
-Dapiml.security.ciphers=<cipher-list>
```

On localhost, you can override the default configuration in [config/local/gateway-service.yml](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/blob/master/config/local/gateway-service.yml) (including other YAML files for development purposes).

The following list shows the default ciphers. API ML services use the following cipher order:

**Note:** Ensure that the version of Java you use is compatible with the default cipherset.

```
   TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
   TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
   TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384
```

Only IANA ciphers names are supported. For more information, see [Cipher Suites](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Cipher_suites) or [List of Ciphers](https://testssl.net/openssl-iana.mapping.html).

## JWT Token

The JWT secret that signs the JWT Token is an asymmetric private key that is generated during Zowe keystore configuration. The JWT token is signed with the RS256 signature algorithm.

You can find the JWT secret, alias `localhost`, in the PKCS12 keystore that is stored in `${KEYSTORE_DIRECTORY}/localhost/localhost.keystore.p12`. The public key necessary to validate the JWT signature is read from the keystore.

You can also use the `/gateway/api/v1/auth/keys/public/all` endpoint to obtain all public keys that can be used to verify JWT tokens signature in standard [JWK format](https://openid.net/specs/).

## z/OSMF JSON Web Tokens Support

Your z/OSMF instance can be enabled to support JWT tokens as described at [Enabling JSON Web Token support](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.izua300/izuconfig_EnableJSONWebTokens.htm).
In this case, the Zowe API ML uses this JWT token and does not generate its own Zowe JWT token. All authentication APIs, such as `/gateway/api/v1/login` and `/gateway/api/v1/check` function in the same way as without z/OSMF JWT.
Gateway service endpoint `/gateway/api/v1/auth/keys/public/all` serves the z/OSMF JWK that can be used for JWT signature validation.
