# Starting, stopping, and monitoring Zowe containers

After Zowe's containers are installed and configured, you can refer to the following topics that help you manage your installation.

## Starting Zowe containers

The Kubernetes cluster will automatically start as many containers as needed per service according to the Deployment configuration.

To apply the deployment files, run this command:

```
kubectl apply -f workloads/
```

### Port forwarding (for minikube only)

[Kubectl port-forward](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/) allows you to access and interact with internal Kubernetes cluster processes from your localhost. For debugging or development, you might want to port forward to make Zowe gateway or discovery service available externally quickly.

Before issuing port forward commands, make sure that gateway and discovery services pods are running. You can run `kubectl get pods -n zowe` and check if the `STATUS` of both `discovery-*` and `gateway-*` is `RUNNING`. If not, you may have to wait.

Once both `STATUS` shows `RUNNING`, run the following command to port forward:

```
kubectl port-forward -n zowe svc/gateway-service --address=<your-ip> <external-port>:<internal-port, such as 7554> &
kubectl port-forward -n zowe svc/discovery-service --address=<your-ip> <external-port>:<internal-port, such as 7553> &
```

The `&` sign at the command will run the command as a background process. Otherwise, the port forward process will occupy the terminal indefinitely until canceled as a foreground service.  

## Verifying Zowe containers

The containers will start soon after applying the deployments.

To verify:

1. `kubectl get deployments --namespace zowe`
   
   This command must show you a list of deployments including `explorer-jes`, `gateway-service`, `app-server`, etc. Each deployment should show `1/1` in `READY` column. It could take a moment before all deployments say `1/1`.

2. `kubectl get statefulsets --namespace zowe`

   This command must show you a StatefulSet `discovery` which `READY` column should be `1/1`.

3. `kubectl get cronjobs --namespace zowe`
   
   This command must show you a CronJob `cleanup-static-definitions` which `SUSPEND` should be `False`.

## Monitoring Zowe containers

You can monitor Zowe containers using a UI or CLI.

### Monitoring Zowe containers via UI

Kubernetes provides a container that allows you to manage your cluster through a web browser. When using Docker Desktop, it is already installed in the namespace `kubernetes-dashboard`. See the [Kubernetes website](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/) for install instructions.

[Metrics Server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server) is also recommended and is required if you want to define [Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/). Check if you have `metrics-server` `Service` in `kube-system` namespace with this command `kubectl get services --namespace kube-system`. If you don't have it, you can follow this [Installation](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server#installation) instruction to install it.

### Monitoring Zowe containers via CLI

`kubectl` allows you to see the status of any kind of object with the `get` command. This applies to the [table in the configuring section](#configuring) but also for the pods that run the Zowe containers.

Here are a few commands you can use to monitor your environment:

* `kubectl get pods -n zowe` lists the status of the components of Zowe.
* `kubectl describe pods -n zowe <podid>` can see more details about each pod.
* `kubectl logs -n zowe <podid>` will show you the terminal output of a particular pod, with `-f` allowing you to keep the logs open as new messages are added.
* `kubectl get nodes -n zowe -owide` will tell you more about the environment you're running.

## Stopping, pausing or removing Zowe containers

To temporarily stop a component, locate the `Deployment` component and scale down to `0`. For example, if you want to stop the `jobs-api` container, run this command:

```
kubectl scale -n zowe deployment jobs-api --replicas=0
```

You can later re-enable a component by scaling the component back to 1 or more.

If you want to permanently remove a component, you can delete the component `Deployment`. To use `jobs-api` as an example, run this command:

```
kubectl delete -n zowe deployment jobs-api
```
