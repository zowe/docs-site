- [Installing Zowe CLI from a local package](#installing-zowe-cli-from-a-local-package)
- [Installing Zowe CLI from an online registry](#installing-zowe-cli-from-an-online-registry)

If you encounter problems when you attempt to install Zowe CLI, see [Troubleshooting Zowe CLI](../troubleshoot/cli/troubleshoot-cli.md).

### Installing Zowe CLI from a local package

If you do not have internet access at your site, use the following method to install Zowe CLI from a local package.

**Follow these steps:**

1. Address the following software requirements for the core CLI:

    - Install [Node.js V8.0 or higher LTS versions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

        **Tip:** You might need to restart the command prompt after installing Node.js. Issue the command `node --version` to verify that Node.js is installed.

    - Verify that you have **Node Package Manager (npm)** that is compatible with your version of Node.js. For a list of compatible versions, see [Node.js Previous Releases](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/).

        **Tip:** npm is included with the Node.js installation. Issue the command `npm --version` to verify the version of npm that is installed.

2. **(Linux only)** Address the following software requirements for Secure Credential Storage:

   - **(Graphical Linux)** Install `gnome-keyring` and `libsecret` on your computer.

   - **(Headless Linux)** Follow the procedure documented in the [SCS plug-in Readme](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli-scs-plugin/blob/master/README.md#software-requirements).

3. Navigate to [Zowe.org Downloads](https://www.zowe.org/download.html) and click the **CLI Core** button to download the core package. The "core" includes Zowe CLI and Secure Credential Store, which enhances security by encrypting your username and password.

    A file named `zowe-cli-package-v.r.m.zip` is downloaded to your computer

4. **(Optional)** Click the **CLI Plugins** button to download the optional plugins.

   A file named `zowe-cli-plugins-v.r.m.zip` is downloaded to your computer.

5. Unzip the contents of `zowe-cli-package-v.r.m.zip` (and optionally `zowe-cli-plugins-v.r.m.zip`) to a preferred location on your computer.

6. Open a command-line window. Issue the following commands in sequence against the extracted directory to install core Zowe CLI on your computer:

    ```
    npm install -g zowe-cli.tgz
    ```

    ```
    zowe plugins install secure-credential-store-for-zowe-cli.tgz
    ```

    **Notes:**
    - If the command returns an `EACCESS` error, refer to [Resolving EACCESS permissions errors when installing packages globally](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally) in the npm documentation.
    - On Linux, you might need to prepend `sudo` to your `npm` commands. For more information, see [Troubleshooting Zowe CLI](../troubleshoot/cli/troubleshoot-cli.md).

7. **(Optional)** Address the [Software requirements for CLI plug-ins](cli-swreqplugins.md). You can install most plug-ins without meeting the requirements, but they will not function until you configure the back-end APIs. The IBM Db2 plug-in requires [additional configuration to install](cli-db2plugin.md#installing).

8. **(Optional)** Issue the following command to install each available plug-in:

    ```
    zowe plugins install cics-for-zowe-cli.tgz db2-for-zowe-cli.tgz zos-ftp-for-zowe-cli.tgz  ims-for-zowe-cli.tgz mq-for-zowe-cli.tgz
    ```

    **Important:** Ensure that you meet the [Software requirements for CLI plug-ins](cli-swreqplugins.md). You can install most plug-ins without meeting the requirements, but they will not function until you configure the back-end APIs. The IBM Db2 plug-in requires [additional configuration to install](cli-db2plugin.md#installing).

Zowe CLI is installed on your computer. Issue the `zowe --help` command to view a list of available commands. For information about how to connect the CLI to the mainframe, create profiles, integrate with API ML, and more, see [Using CLI](cli-usingcli.md).
