## New features and enhancements

Zowe Version 2.3.0 contains the enhancements that are described in the following topics.

### Zowe installation and packaging

- Added a new dataset SZWELOAD. It contains versions of configmgr named `ZWECFG31`, `ZWECFG64`, and `ZWERXCFG` which can be used to invoke configmgr from within a rexx program. The expected use case is to simplify how complex JCL gets configuration information about Zowe.
- Zowe can now start in a mode called `configmgr` mode. You can enable this in certain `zwe` commands by adding `--configmgr`. Not all commands support this yet. For now, you can use it in `zwe start`, `zwe stop`, and `zwe components`. This mode is generally significantly faster to start up Zowe, but also enforces validation of the `zowe.yaml` configuration against the `zowe.yaml` schema files (found in /schemas).
- Zowe can now start using multiple `zowe.yaml` files when using the `configmgr` mode. This works for the STC startup as well as the `zwe start`, `zwe stop`, and `zwe components` commands. Each file must follow the same `zowe.yaml` schema as before, but in the list of files, properties found in a file to the right will be overridden by the file to the left. Through this, you can separate portions of Zowe configuration any way you want. To use multiple files, change your existing --config / CONFIG input to instead be a list of FILE() entries which are colon `:` separated. For example, `zwe start --config FILE(/my/customizations.yaml):FILE(/zowe/defaults.yaml)`
- Zowe server YAML files can now have templates within them when using `configmgr` mode. When the value of any attribute contains `${{ }}`, the content within the brackets will be replaced with whatever the template evaluates to. The entries are processed as ECMAScript2020-compatible JavaScript assignments. You can, for example, set one property to the value of another, such as having `parmlib: ${{ zowe.setup.dataset.prefix }}.MYPARM` rather than needing to type the prefix explicitly. You can also use this to set conditionals. For examples, check the [ZSS default yaml file](https://github.com/zowe/zss/blob/013d11d700003483fde38e1df0a373bb5bd4ef8c/defaults.yaml).

### Zowe Application Framework

#### Zowe App Server 

- app-server can now be configured by using configmgr. This increases startup time and validation of components and their plugins to increase automatic detection of plugin compatibility issues. This mode can be enabled or disabled with Zowe configuration property `zowe.useConfigmgr=true/false`.

#### Zowe Common C

- Added a new build target `configmgr-rexx`, which builds a version of configmgr that can be used within rexx scripts.

#### ZSS

- ZSS now utilizes the configuration parameters present in the zowe configuration file via the configmgr, simplifying the startup of ZSS and increasing the validation of its parameters. The file `zss/defaults.yaml` shows the default configuration parameters of zss, in combination with the schema of the parameters within zss/schemas, though some parameters are derived from zowe-wide parameters or from other components when they involve those other components.
- Improved startup time due to using the configmgr to process plugin registration, and only when the app-server is not enabled, as the app-server does the same thing.

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

## Bug fixes

Zowe Version 2.3.0 contains the bug fixes that are described in the following topics.

### Zowe installation and packaging

- Schema pattern for semver range has been simplified as it was not compiling in configmgr
- When zwe components install could not find or set the PC bit of a ZSS plugin, it would print out an example command for fixing the issue. Now, it shows the exact command you could execute to fix the PC bit problem.

### Zowe Application Framework

#### Zowe App Server

- Schema regex pattern for semver range was not working in configmgr, and has been corrected.

#### Zowe Common C

- Fixed `lht` functions of `collections.c` to avoid memory issues on negative keys
- Fixed the help message on configmgr

#### ZSS

- Fixed an 0C4 error within the /unixfile API in 31-bit mode. This was preventing files from being shown in the editor.
- 0C4 error messages from dataservices are now shown under the SEVERE log instead of the DEBUG log, so that issues can be spotted more easily.
- 0C4 when lht hashmap functions were called with negative key

### Zowe CLI

Zowe CLI and related components contain the following bug fixes:

- Updated Imperative to include bug fixes in version 5.5.1.
- Renamed `download data-set-matching` to `download data-sets-matching`. The old name still exists as an alias.
- Fixed output of `download data-sets-matching` being printed twice when some data sets fail to download.
- Altered the `zowe daemon disable` command to kill only the daemon running for the current user.

#### Zowe CLI (Core)
