### Zowe Application Framework

* Unified container and non-container behavior. Changed how app-server scripts locate app-server directories so that they work in container mode, where the folder layout is different.
* If the hostname is not explicitly specified, use `GATEWAY_HOST` environment variable over `ZOWE_EXPLORER_HOST` to find mediation layer gateway.
* Zlux Server Framework improved `callRootService` when targeting agents such as ZSS to issue the direct request to destination rather than using an additional loopback request to the app-server. This improves performance, reduces the need for the app-server being a client of itself, and allows for more request options when calling the agent.
* Allowed timeout parameter to be specified in a `callService` or `callRootService` command, such as when needing a long timeout to request an agent response.
* Removed the requirement for app-server to be a client of itself when using the `callService` API by adding the option for requests to this API to be executed that is internal to app-server. This option is compatible with the pre-existing use of `callService`  however, it is disabled by default to avoid disruption. You can enable it by setting the server configuration property `node.internalRouting=true`.
* Allowed new `pluginDefinition` `webContent` destination variable for substitution, `ZWE_EXTERNAL_PORT` that matches the environment variable value, or if absent, the gateway or app-server ports conditional to configuration.
* App-server's `uninstall-app.sh` script is now available in the instance `bin` folder.
* Zss's `zis-plugin-install.sh` script is now available in the instance `bin/utils` folder.
* Added an endpoint for PassTicket generation.
* Added an endpoint for user information.
* Added method to read and set `loglevel` of dataservices.
* Updated material UI.
* Updated webpack `build` and `dev` configuration.

The following enhancements were added to the Editor:
* Added previously selected content comparison (Diff viewer).
* Removed the Cancel button and replaced it with ‘X’ button on all dialogue pop-ups.
* Added toggle bar to show and hide File Explorer.

### Zowe CLI

The following enhancements were added to the **core CLI**:
- Removed the misleading `workflow-name` option for the `zowe zos-workflows list definition-file-details` help example. [#659](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/659)
- Exposed new option `modifyVersion` for the `zowe zos-jobs delete job` and `zowe zos-jobs cancel job` commands. [#1092](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1092)
- Add support for PEM certificate based authentication.
- Update post-install script to display a message when the CLI successfully installs due to increased error messaging from USS SDK when optional pre-requisites are not installed.

The following enhancement was added to the **Imperative CLI Framework**:
- Export the Imperative Command Tree on the data object of the `zowe --ac` command when `--rfj` is specified.
- Implemented the ability to authenticate using client certificates in PEM format.


### Zowe Explorer

- Added a check to ensure that a base profile exists before running the function that combines base and service profiles [#1500](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-explorer-vscode/pull/1500).
- Added Imperative logger access for extenders [#1433](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-explorer-vscode/pull/1433). 
- Added documentation for Imperative logger for extenders [#1467](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-explorer-vscode/pull/1467). 
- Implemented separate console windows for TSO and MVS commands [#1478](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-explorer-vscode/pull/1478).

### Zowe Application Framework

* Fixed an issue with using `app2app` where incorrectly formatted data would not honor `launch/message` `requesthp`.
* `app-server` would ignore when `VERIFY_CERTIFICATE=false` was set, and try to verify `APIML` servers. This would lead to login failures when `APIML` server was on a different system than app-server. Now, app-server will verify `APIML` certificates based on `VERIFY_CERTIFICATE` value.
* Fixed an issue where `app-server` could throw an uncaught exception when a proxied server had a socket error.

The following bugs were fixed in the Editor:
* Fixed an issue where switching from the Diff viewer to code editing body causes rendering bugs.
* Fixed an issue when fileCopy incorrectly processed files tagged as binary and mixed.
* Fixed an issue where Unixfile Copy and Rename API doesn`t support distinct error status response.
* Fixed an issue where dataset contents API returns invalid error status for undefined length dataset update request.
* Fixed an issue where Unixfile Copy service incorrectly processed files tagged as binary and mixed.
* Fixed an issue where Unixfile Copy and Rename directory API does not support `forceOverwrite` query.
* Fixed the error message and phantom tab when opening undefined length dataset.
