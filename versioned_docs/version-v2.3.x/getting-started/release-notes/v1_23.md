## New features and enhancements

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

* Authentication based server-side load balancing. A service can now configure itself with the Authentication-based load balancing scheme whereby a user is directed to the same instance of a service for a given period of time (#1576) ([4ad382e](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/commit/4ad382e)), closes [#1576](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1576).
