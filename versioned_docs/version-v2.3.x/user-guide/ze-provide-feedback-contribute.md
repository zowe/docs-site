# Providing feedback and contributing

To help make Zowe Explorer CICS Extension better, you are welcome to contribute in many forms:

## Checking the source of an error

Before filing an issue, check if an error is arising from the Zowe Explorer for IBM CICS extension instead of the Zowe Explorer extension. To check the error source, expand the error message and review the `Source` description.

- Errors arising from the Zowe Explorer CICS extension have the `Source` as `Zowe Explorer for IBM CICS (Extension)`,
- Errors arising from the Zowe Explorer extension have the `Source` as `Zowe Explorer (Extension)`.
