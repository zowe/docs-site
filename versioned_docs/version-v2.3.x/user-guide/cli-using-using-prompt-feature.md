# Using the prompt feature

Zowe CLI has a command-line "prompt" feature that asks you to provide required option values. The CLI always prompts for host, port, username, and password if you do not supply them in commands or profile configuration.

You can also manually enable the prompt for any option. This is helpful to mask sensitive information on the screen while you type. You can enable a one-time prompt, or choose to always prompt for a particular option.
