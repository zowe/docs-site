## Configuring security

Configure Zowe and your z/OS system to run Zowe with z/OS.

| Task | Results | Time Estimate |  
|--------------------|----|------|
|[Review Configuring security](./configuring-security.md) | Knowledge about which tasks need to be performed by the security administrator. | 10 minutes|
[Initialize Zowe security configurations](./initialize-security-configuration) |  The JCL member to configure the z/OS system is created.   | 10 minutes | 
[Perform APF authorization of load libraries](./apf-authorize-load-library.md) | APF authorization is granted to load libraries.  | 10 minutes  | 
[Address z/OS requirements for Zowe](./configure-zos-system.md) | Your z/OS and security product are configured.  | 2 hours  |
[Assign security permissions to users](./assign-security-permissions-to-users.md) | Zowe user is created and is assigned all required permissions.  | 30 minutes |


## Configuring certificates

Zowe is able to use PKCS12 certificates or certificates held in a z/OS Keyring.

| Task | Results | Time Estimate |  
|--------------------|----|------|
| Read the article [Zowe certificate configuration overview](../user-guide/configure-certificates.md). Then use one of the following options:<br /><br /> **Option 1: Choose the [certificate configuration scenario](../user-guide/certificate-configuration-scenarios.md)** that best applies to your use case, and follow the configuration procedure and scenario template. <br /> <br /> **Option 2: [Set up Zowe certificates using workflows](../user-guide/certificates-setup.md)** | Your certificates are configured and stored securely. |2 hours  

## Configuring the Zowe cross memory server (ZIS)

The Zowe cross memory server (ZIS) provides privileged cross-memory services to the Zowe Desktop and runs as an APF-authorized program.

:::note
To start Zowe without the desktop (for example to launch just the API Mediation Layer), you do not need to install and configure the cross memory server and can skip this step.
:::

| Task | Results | Time Estimate |  
|--------------------|----|------|
| [Configure the Zowe cross memory server (ZIS)](./configure-xmem-server.md) | * JCL member `ZWESISTC` is copied from `SZWESAMP` installation PDS to a PDS on the JES concatenation path. <br /> * The PDSE Load Library `SZWEAUTH` is APF-authorized, or the load module `ZWESIS01` is copied to an existing APF Auth LoadLib.<br /> * The JCL member `ZWESISTC DD` statements are updated to point to the location of `ZWESIS01` and `ZWESIP00`. | 30 minutes 

## Configuring High Availability (optional)

You can configure your system to enable HA. This configuration is not required to run a single instance of Zowe. 

| Task | Results | Time Estimate |  
|--------------------|----|------|
| [Configure Sysplex for high availability](../user-guide/configure-sysplex.md) | The Parallel Sysplex environment is set up.  | 30 minutes | 
 [Configure z/OSMF for high availability in Sysplex](../user-guide/systemrequirements-zosmf-ha.md)| The z/OSMF server is set up to provide continuous availability of REST services.  | 30 minutes | 
[Configure the Caching Service for HA](../user-guide/configure-caching-service-ha.md)| State data persistent in HA mode is centralized.  | 30 minutes |
[Define the `haInstances` section in your zowe.yaml](../appendix/zowe-yaml-configuration/#yaml-configurations---hainstances)| A dedicated section for `haInstances` is created in your zowe.yaml file. | 30 minutes |

## Starting and Stopping Zowe  

| Start/Stop Step | Task | Results | Time Estimate |  
|----|-----------|----|-------------|
|[Start and stop the cross memory server `ZWESISTC` on z/OS](../user-guide/start-zowe-zos.md#starting-and-stopping-the-cross-memory-server-zwesistc-on-zos) | The `ZWESISTC` task starts and stops the `ZWESASTC` task as needed | The cross memory server is run as a started task from the JCL in the PROCLIB member `ZWESISTC` | 5 minutes|
|Start and stop the Zowe main server `ZWESLSTC` on z/OS |**Option 1: [Use zwe to start and stop the main Zowe server](../user-guide/start-zowe-zos.md#starting-and-stopping-zowe-main-server-zweslstc-on-zos-with-zwe-server-command)**<br /><p></p>**Option 2: [Manually start and stop the Zowe main server `ZWESLSTC`](../user-guide/start-zowe-zos.md#starting-and-stopping-zowe-main-server-zweslstc-on-zos-manually)** | You started or stopped Zowe main server `ZWESLSTC` on z/OS with `zwe` or manually | 20 minutes |

## Verifying Zowe installation on z/OS

| Verification Step | Task | Results | Time Estimate | 
|----|-----------|----|-------------|
| [Verify Zowe Application Framework installation](../user-guide/verify-zowe-runtime-install.md#verifying-zowe-application-framework-installation) | Open the Zowe Desktop from a supported browser | You should be able to open the Zowe Desktop from a supported browser. | 20 minutes| 
| [Verify API Mediation installation](../user-guide/verify-zowe-runtime-install.md#verifying-api-mediation-installation) |Use a REST API client to review the value of the status variable of the API Catalog service routed through the API Gateway | See the example presented in Verify API Mediation installation | 15 minutes |
|[Verify z/OS Services installation](../user-guide/verify-zowe-runtime-install.md#verifying-zos-services-installation) |Zowe z/OS services usually are registered with Zowe APIML Discovery| You should see JSON format data of all jobs running on the system | 15 minutes |
