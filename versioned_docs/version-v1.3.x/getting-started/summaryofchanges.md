## Version 1.1.0 (April 2019)

Version 1.1.0 contains the following changes since the last 1.0.x version.

### What's new in Zowe system requirements
z/OSMF Lite is now available for non-production use such as development, proof-of-concept, demo and so on. It simplifies the setup of z/OSMF with only a minimal amount of z/OS customization, but provides key functions that are required. For more information, see [Configuring z/OSMF Lite (for non-production use)](../user-guide/systemrequirements-zosmf-lite.md).

### What's new in the Zowe App Server
- Made the following user experience improvements:
  - Enabled the Desktop to react to session expiration information from the Zowe Application Server. If a user is active the Desktop renews their session before it expires. If a user appears inactive they are prompted  and can click to renew the session. If they don't click, they are logged out with a session expired message.
  - Added the ability to programmatically dismiss popups created with the "zlux-widgets" popup manager.

Version 1.0.1 contains the following changes since the last version.

### What's new in Zowe installation on z/OS

During product operation of the Zowe Cross Memory Server which was introduced in V1.0.0, the z/OSMF user ID IZUSVR or its equivalent must have UPDATE access to the BPX.SERVER and BPX.DAEMON FACILITY classes. The install script will do this automatically if the installing user has enough authority, or provide the commands to be issued manually if not. For more information, see [Installing the Zowe Cross Memory Server on z/OS](../user-guide/install-zos#installing-the-zowe-cross-memory-server-on-z-os)

### What's new in the Zowe App Server

- Made the following improvements to security:
  - Removed the insecure SHA1 cipher from the Zowe App Server's supported ciphers list.
  - Added instructions to REST APIs to not cache potentially sensitive response contents.
  - Set secure attributes to desktop and z/OSMF session cookies.
- Fixed a bug that caused the configuration data service to mishandle PUT operations with bodies that were not JSON.

- Fixed various bugs in the File Explorer and updated it to use newer API changes.
- Fixed a bug in which App2App Communication Actions could be duplicated upon logging in a second time on the same desktop.

### What's new in Zowe CLI

- Create and Manage z/OSMF Workflows using the new `zos-workflows` command group. For more information, see [Zowe CLI command groups.](../user-guide/cli-usingcli.md#zowe-cli-command-groups)

- Use the `@lts-incremental` tag when you install and update Zowe CLI core or plug-ins. The tag ensures that you don't consume breaking changes that affect your existing scripts. Installation procedures are updated to reflect this change.

- A [CLI quick start guide](cli-getting-started.md) is now available for users who are familiar with command-line tools and want to get up and running quickly.

- Zowe CLI Plugin for IBM CICS was updated to support communication over HTTPS. Users can enable https by specifying `--protocol https` when creating a profile or issuing a command. For backwards compatibility, HTTP remains the default protocol.

### What's new in the Zowe REST APIs

Introduced new Unix files APIs that reside in the renamed API catalog tile `z/OS Datasets and Unix files service` (previously named `z/OS Datasets service`). You can use these APIs to:

- List the children of a Unix directory
- Get the contents of a Unix file

### What's changed

- **Zowe explorer apps**
   - JES Explorer: Enhanced Info/Error messages to better help users diagnose problems.
   - MVS Explorer: Fixed an issue where Info/Error messages were not displayed when loading a Dataset/Members contents.

## Version 1.0.0 (February 2019)

Version 1.0.0 contains the following changes since the Open Beta release.

### What's new in API Mediation Layer

- HTTPs is now supported on all Java enablers for onboarding API microservices with the API ML.  

- SSO authentication using z/OSMF has been implemented for the API Catalog login.  Mainframe credentials are required for access.

### What's new in Zowe CLI

-  **Breaking change to Zowe CLI**: The `--pass` command option is changed to `--password` for all core Zowe CLI commands for clarity and to be consistent with plug-ins. If you have zosmf profiles that you created prior to January 11, 2019, you must recreate them to use the `--password` option. The aliases `--pw` and `--pass` still function when you issue commands as they did prior to this breaking change. You do not need to modify scripts that use  `--pass`.

- The `@next` npm tag used to install Zowe CLI is deprecated. Use the `@latest` npm tag to install the product with the online registry method.

### What's new in the Zowe Desktop

- You can now obtain information about an application by right-clicking on an application icon and then clicking **Properties**.

- To view version information for the desktop, click the avatar in the lower right corner of the desktop.

- Additional information was added for the Workflow application.

- The titlebar of the active window is now colored to give an at-a-glance indication of which window is in the foreground.

- Window titlebar maximize button now changes style to indicate whether a window is maximized.

- Windows now have a slight border around them to help see boundaries and determine which window is active.

- Multiple instances of the same application can be opened and tracked from the launchbar. To open multiple instances, right-click and choose **Open New**.
Once multiple instances are open, you can click the application icon to select which application to bring to the foreground. The number of orbs below the application icon relates to the number of instances of the application that is open.

- Desktop framework logging trimmed and formalized to the Zowe App Logger. For more information, see [https://github.com/zowe/zlux/wiki/Logging](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/wiki/Logging).

- The UriBroker was updated to support dataservice versioning and UNIX file API updates.

- Removed error messages about missing `components.js` by making this optional component explicitly declared within an application. By using the property "webContent.hasComponents = true/false".

- Set the maximum username and password length for login to 100 characters each.

- Applications can now list webContent.framework = "angular" as an alias for "angular2".

- Fixed a bug where the desktop might not load on high latency networks.

### What's new in the Zowe App Server

- HTTP support was disabled in favor of HTTPS-only hosting.

- The server can be configured to bind to specific IPs or to hostnames. Previously, the server would listen on all interfaces. For more information, see [https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/30](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/30).

- The core logger prefixes for the Zowe App Server were changed from "_unp" to "_zsf".

- Dataservices are now versioned, and dataservices can depend on specific versions of other dataservices. A plug-in can include more than one version of a dataservice for compatibility. For more information, see [https://github.com/zowe/zlux/wiki/ZLUX-Dataservices](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/wiki/ZLUX-Dataservices).

- Support to communicate with the API Mediation Layer with the use of keys and certificates was added.

- Trimmed and corrected error messages regarding unconfigured proxies for clarity and understanding. For more information, see [https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/33](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/33).

- Fixed the `nodeCluster.sh` script to have its logging and environment variable behavior consistent with `nodeServer.sh`.

- Removed the "swaggerui" plug-in in favor of the API Catalog.

- Bugfix for `/plugins` API to not show the installation location of the plug-in.

- Bugfix to print a warning if the server finds two plug-ins with the same name.

- Added the ability to conditionally add HTTP headers for secure services to instruct the browser not to cache the responses. For more information, see [https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/issues/36](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/issues/36).

- Added a startup check to confirm that ZSS is running as a prerequisite of the Zowe App Server.

- Bugfix for sending HTTP 404 response when content is missing, instead of a request hanging.

- Added tracing of login, logout, and HTTP routing so that administrators can track access.

### What's changed

- Previously,  APIs for z/OS Jobs services and z/OS Data Set services are provided unsing an IBM WebSphere Liberty web application server. In this release, they are provided using a Tomcat web application server. You can view the associated API documentation corresponding to the z/OS services through the API Catalog.

- References to `zlux-example-server` were changed to `zlux-app-server` and references to `zlux-proxy-server` were changed to `zlux-server-framework`.

### Known issues

**Paste operations from the Zowe Desktop TN3270 and VT Terminal applications**

**TN3270 App** - If you are using Firefox, the option to use Ctrl+V to paste is not available. Instead, press Shift + right-click to access the paste option through the context menu.

Pressing Ctrl+V will perform paste for the TN3270 App on other browsers.

**VT Terminal App** - In the VT Terminal App, Ctrl+V will not perform a paste operation for any browser.

**Note:** In both terminals, press Shift + right-click to access copy and paste options through the context menu.

**z/OS Subsystems App** - The z/OS Subsystems application is being removed temporarily for the 1.0 release.  The reason is that as the ZSS has transitioned from closed to open source some APIs needed to be re-worked and are not complete yet.  Look for the return of the application in a future update.
