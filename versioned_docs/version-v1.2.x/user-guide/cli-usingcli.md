# Using Zowe CLI

This section contains information about using Zowe CLI.

## Displaying Zowe CLI help

Zowe CLI contains a help system that is embedded directly into the command-line interface. Issue help commands that provide you with information about the product, syntax, and usage.

### Displaying top-level help 

To begin using the product, open a command line window and issue the following command to view the top-level help descriptions:

```
zowe --help
```

![Issuing the help command](../images/guides/CLI/GetHelp.gif)

**Tip:** The command `zowe` initiates the product on a command line. All Zowe CLI commands begin with `zowe.`

### Displaying command group, action, and object help

You can use the `--help` global option get more information about a specific command group, action, or object.

```
zowe <group, action, or object name> --help
```

```
zowe zos-files create --help
```

## Zowe CLI command reference guide 

View the [CLI Command Reference Guide](../CLIReference_Zowe.pdf) for a detailed documentation on commands, actions, and options in Zowe CLI. The reference document is based on the `@lts-incremental` version of the CLI.

## Zowe CLI command groups
Zowe CLI contains command groups that focus on specific business processes. For example, the `zos-files` command group
provides the ability to interact with mainframe data sets. This article provides you with a brief synopsis of the tasks that you can perform with each group. For more information, see [Display Zowe CLI Help](#displaying-zowe-cli-help). 

The commands available in the product are organized in a hierarchical structure. Command groups (for example, `zos-files`) contain actions (for example, `create`) that let you perform actions on specific objects (for example, a specific type of data set). For each action that you perform on an object, you can specify options that affect the operation of the command.

**Important!** Before you issue these commands, verify that you
completed the steps in [Create a Zowe CLI profile](cli-configuringcli.md#creating-zowe-cli-profiles) and [Test Connection to z/OSMF](cli-configuringcli.md#testing-zowe-cli-connection-to-z-osmf) to help ensure that Zowe CLI can communicate with z/OS systems.

Zowe CLI contains the following command groups:

### plugins

```

## Writing scripts to automate mainframe actions

You can combine multiple Zowe CLI commands in bash or shell scripts to automate actions on z/OS. You can implement scripts to enhance your development workflow, automate repetitive test or build tasks, and orchestrate mainframe actions from continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) tools such as Jenkins or TravisCI. 

- [Writing a Script](#writing-a-script)
- [Example: Clean up Temporary Data Sets](#exampleOne)
- [Example: Submit Jobs and Save Spool Output](#exampleTwo)

### Writing a Script

Write a script that executes multiple CLI commands.

**Note:** The type of script that you write depends on the programming languages that you use and the environment where the script is executed. The following procedure is a general guide to Zowe CLI scripts, but you might need to refer to third-party documentation to learn more about scripting in general.

**Follow these steps:**

1. Create a new file on your computer with the extension .sh. For example, `testScript.sh`.

    **Note:** On Linux, an extension is not required. You make the file executable by issuing the command `chmod u+x testScript`.

2. At the top of the file, specify the interpreter that your script requires. For example, type `#!/bin/sh` or `#!/bin/sh`.

    **Note:** The command terminal that you use to execute the script depends on what you specify at the top of your script. Bash scripts require a bash interpreter (bash terminal), while shell scripts can be run from any terminal.

3. Write a script using a series of Zowe CLI commands.

    **Tip:** You can incorporate commands from other command-line tools in the same script. You might choose to "pipe" the output of one command into another command.

4. From the appropriate command terminal, issue a command to execute the script. The command you use to execute script varies by operating system.

The script runs and prints the output in your terminal. You can run scripts manually, or include them in your automated testing and delivery pipelines.

### <span id="exampleOne">Example: Clean up Temporary Data Sets</span>

The script in this example lists specified data sets, then loops through the list of data sets and deletes each file. You can use a similar script to clean up temporary data sets after use.

**Note:** This script must be run from a bash terminal. 

```
#!/bin/bash
set -e
# Project cleanup script - deletes temporary project data sets
# Obtain the list of temporary project data sets 
dslist=$(zowe files ls ds "my.project.ds*")
# Delete each data set in the list
IFS=$'\n'
for ds in $dslist
do
     echo "Deleting Temporary Project Dataset: $ds"
     zowe files delete ds "$ds" -f
done
```

### <span id="exampleTwo">Example: Submit Jobs and Save Spool Output</span>

The script in this example submits a job, waits for the job to enter output status, and saves the spool files to local files on your computer.

**Note:** This script must be run from a bash terminal.

```
#! /bin/env bash
#submit our job
jobid=$(zowe zos-jobs submit data-set "boech02.public.cntl(iefbr14)" --rff jobid --rft string)
echo "Submitted our job, JOB ID is $jobid"
#wait for job to go to output
status="UNKNOWN"
while [[ "$status" != "OUTPUT"]]; do
    echo "Checking
    status of job $jobid" status=$(zowe zos-jobs view job-status-by-jobid "$jobid" --rff status --rft string)
    echo "Current status is $status"
    sleep 5s
done;
echo "Job completed in OUTPUT status. Final result of job: "
zowe zos-jobs view job-status-by-jobid "$jobid"
# get a list of all of the spool files for our job now that it's in output
spool_ids=$(zowe zos-jobs list spool-files-by-jobid "$jobid" --rff id --rft table)
# save each spool ID to a custom file name
while read -r id; do
     zowe zos-jobs view spool-file-by-id "$jobid" "$id" > ./${jobid}_spool_${id}.txt
     echo "Saved spool DD to ./${jobid}_spool_${id}.txt"
done <<< "$spool_ids"
```
