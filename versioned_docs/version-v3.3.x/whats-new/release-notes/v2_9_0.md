### Zowe installation and packaging
* Users who have not set the value of `zowe.useConfigmgr` will now have the behavior set to `true`. If you still wish to use false, set `zowe.useConfigmgr=false` explicitly. ([#3423](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/3423))

### Zowe Application Framework
#### Zlux Server Framework
* `zowe.certificates.pem` is no longer needed when using keyrings. ([#448](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/448))

#### Zowe Common C
* `configmgr's` z/OS module now has a `resolveSymbol` function which takes a string starting with `&` which can be used to resolve static and dynamic z/OS symbols. ([#378](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/378))
### Zowe API Mediation Layer

* Personal access tokens are now accepted as Bearer authentication and in the `apimlAuthenticationToken` cookie. ([7c393a6](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/commit/7c393a6), closes [#2908](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2908))
* A OAuth2 access token is now accepted as an authentication source. ([3809622](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/commit/3809622), closes [#2835](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2835))
* The maximum idle timeout for websocket connections (between the gateway and the registered service) is now configurable. ([020da87](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/commit/020da87), closes [#2914](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2914))
### Imperative CLI Framework

- Added the function `IO.giveAccessOnlyToOwner` to restrict access to only the currently running user ID for security. ([#987](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/pull/987))
- Enabled command arguments to change `{$Prefix}_EDITOR`. Updated `IDiffOptions` to include names for the files that are to be compared. Updated `IO.getDefaultTextEditor()` for different OS versions. Updated return value types for `CliUtils.readPrompt`. This prepares development of future commands in Zowe CLI. ([#967](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/pull/967))
- Altered `TextUtils` behavior slightly to enable daemon color support without TTY. ([#977](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/pull/977))

### Zowe CLI

- Updated daemon to use `tokio` library instead of the unmaintained `named_pipe` library for technical currency. ([#1710](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/1710))
- Added the `zowe files copy dsclp` command to copy a data set from one LPAR to another, making data transfer between LPARs easier. ([#1098](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1098))
- Re-enabled color in the daemon client to differentiate text displayed in the terminal. ([#1379](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1379))

- Added option to save unique data set attributes as a template after allocation for future use. ([#1425](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-explorer-vscode/issues/1425))
- Added "Cancel Job" feature for job nodes in Jobs panel view. ([#2251](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-explorer-vscode/issues/2251))

- Enabled ANSI in Windows-based terminals to better display progress bars when using daemon mode. ([#1701](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1701))

- Implemented several updates for technical currency. Updated Imperative to allow for special handling of chalk and coloring in daemon client ([#1721](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/1721)). Updated `imperative` to fix undesired behavior in the `zowe config list` command in certain situations ([#1721](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/1721)).
