### Zowe installation and packaging

- `zwe` now has a `zwe config get` and `zwe config validate` command. The get command can be used to get a part of the zowe yaml configuration without needing to read the yaml yourself. `zwe config get` only returns values upon proving the configuration is valid first. `zwe config validate` can be used to perform validation of the zowe configuration files without running any additional actions. This is useful for verifying that a change is valid before starting zowe, for example. 
- A new component management command `zwe components upgrade` allows you to install an already-installed component.
- A new component management command `zwe components uninstall` allows you to remove an installed extension.
- A new component management command `zwe components search` allows you to query for extensions.
- `zwe components` subcommands can now search for, install, and upgrade extensions retrieved via an on-prem or remote package registry. At this time, npm is supported as the registry and package manager technology that `zwe` can use to download content. This is an optional feature and is not enabled by default: it must be configured. View the schema for zowe.yaml to learn more about the "package registry" and "registry handler" technologies to configure for this feature. More information and a recorded demo is available at https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/2980

## Bug fixes

Zowe Version 2.5.0 contains the bug fixes that are described in the following topics.

### Zowe installation and packaging

- Use of DVIPA may cause Zowe to believe a port is not free when it is. Starting in this release, Zowe can narrow its port validation to a specific IP via `zowe.network.vipaIp=some.ip` or bypass the verification via `zowe.network.validatePortFree=false`. Setting this to false will still cause the servers to be unable to connect if the port is not free, but this can be a more accurate and portable setting.
- component configure stages will now have their STDOUT printed when running at the INFO level of zwe verbosity.
- `zwe` was not guaranteeing that the workspace folder had 770 permission when `zowe.useConfigmgr=true` was set

### Zowe Application Framework

#### ZSS 

- In 2.3 and 2.4, `safkeyring://` syntax stopped working, only allowing `safkeyring:////`. Now, support for both is restored.

#### zLUX Editor

- Added a few rules for JCL syntax highlighter
- Set USS path to correct directory, when opening the directory or file in new browser tab respectively

#### Zowe Common C

- Fixed a bug that the configmgr binary would always return rc=0. Now, it has various return codes for the various internal errors or config invalid responses.

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

### Zowe CLI

#### Zowe CLI (Core)

- Documented in the CLI web help that the `--token-type` and `--token-value` options do not apply to SSH commands.
- Updated Imperative to include bug fixes in version `5.7.2`.
- Updated the `zowe zos-files create data-set` command to work without the `--like` flag. ([#1252](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1252))

#### Zowe CLI Imperative Framework

- Added validation for null/undefined command definitions. ([#868](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/868))
- Updated plugins `--login` command option to behave as expected when running in an NPM 9 environment.
- Cleaned up uses of execSync in Imperative where it makes sense to do so.

### Zowe Explorer

- Fixed missing localization for certain VS Code error/info/warning messages. ([#1722](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-explorer-vscode/issues/1722))
- Fixed "Allocate Like" error that prevented proper execution. ([#1973](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-explorer-vscode/issues/1973))
- Fixed de-sync issue between Data Set and Favorites panels when adding or deleting datasets/members that were favorited. ([#1488](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-explorer-vscode/issues/1488))
- Added logging in places where errors were being caught and ignored.
