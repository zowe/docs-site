## New features and enhancements

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

* Enabled Discovery Service class path extensions and Gateway native library extensions (#1987) ([fd03db5](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/commit/fd03db5)), closes [#1987](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1987)
* Added Zaas methods for password change support (#1991) ([7597bd7](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/commit/7597bd7)), closes [#1991](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1991)
* Created API ML sample extension. This extension contains a sample controller (#1947) ([a085cf3](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/commit/a085cf3)), closes [#1947](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1947)
* Removed jwtsecret from usage (#1976) ([62e9d1d](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/commit/62e9d1d)), closes [#1976](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1976)

### Zowe Application Framework

* The app framework and the rest of Zowe no longer requires a PKCS#11 ISCF setup. Previously, PKCS#11 was used for single sign on (SSO) by ZSS, but ZSS now automatically  completes SSO setup at start-up of Zowe through negotiation with the API Mediation Layer Gateway. As a result, SSO is now automatic and enabled by default when the API mediation layer, ZSS, and optionally the app server is enabled. This enhancement will work with existing PKCS#11 setups, but they are no longer used.
* The app framework and the rest of Zowe no longer requires a "jwtsecret" object in the Zowe keystore. Previously, this was used for single sign on (SSO) but SSO has been simplified, and now only HTTPS keys and certificates are needed within the keystore. This enhancement will work with existing keystores but the jwtsecret object is no longer used.

### z/OS FTP Plug-in for Zowe CLI

The following enhancements were added to the **z/OS FTP Plug-in for Zowe CLI**:

* Added second shortcuts to match with Zowe core CLI options.

* Add log masking class for sensitive logs (#2003) ([994b483](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/commit/994b483)), closes [#2003](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2003)
