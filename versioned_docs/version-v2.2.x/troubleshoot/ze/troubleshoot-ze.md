# Troubleshooting Zowe Explorer

As a Zowe Explorer user, you may encounter problems with how the VS Code extension functions. This article presents known Zowe Explorer issues and their solutions.

## Before reaching out for support

1. Is there already a GitHub issue (open or closed) that covers the problem? Check [Zowe Explorer Issues](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/issues).
2. Review the current list of [Known issues](known-ze.md) in documentation. Also, try searching using the Zowe Docs search bar.
3. Collect the following information to help diagnose the issue:
    - Zowe Explorer and VS Code version installed.
    - Node.js and NPM versions installed.
    - Whether you have Zowe CLI and the Secure Credential Store (SCS) Zowe CLI plug-in installed.

      **Note:** Zowe CLI V2 does not require the SCS plug-in to manage security.  Security is now managed by Zowe CLI core functionality.  

    - Your operating system.
    - Zowe Logs, which usually, can be found in `C:\Users\userID\.zowe\zowe\logs`.
