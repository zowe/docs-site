## Report bugs and enhancements

- Report bugs: Download and try one of the latest Zowe builds. Report any bugs you find by [creating a Zowe bug report in GitHub](https://github.com/zowe/community/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=).
- Report enhancements: Got an idea for a feature? Or something you're already using could be improved? [Post an enhancement request in GitHub](https://github.com/zowe/community/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=)! 

If you have an issue that is specific to a sub-project or community team, feel free to submit an issue against a specific repo.

## Fix issues

- There are many issues and bugs with the label `Good first issue` in the [Zowe GitHub repositories](https://github.com/zowe/) to help you get familiar with the contribution process. Check out the following list of GitHub repos to make your contribution! 
   - [Zowe sub-projects repositories](https://github.com/zowe/community/blob/master/README.md#zowe-sub-projects)
   - [Zowe operations squads repositories](https://github.com/zowe/community/blob/master/README.md#zowe-operations-squads)
   
  When you decide to work on an issue, check the comments on that issue to ensure that it's not taken by anyone. If nobody is working on it, comment on that issue to let others know that you want to work on it to avoid duplicate work. The squad can assign that issue to you and provide guidance as well. 

- You can also reach out to the [Zowe squads on Slack](https://github.com/zowe/community/blob/master/README.md#slack) to check with the squads if there is any good starter issue that you can work on. 

## Send a Pull Request 

All code in Zowe aligns with the established [licensing and copyright notice guidelines](https://github.com/zowe/zlc/blob/master/process/LicenseAndCopyrightGuidance.md).

Before submitting a Pull Request, review the general Zowe [Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/zowe/community#pull-request-guidelines) and make sure that you provide the information that is required in the Pull Request template in that specific repo. 

All Zowe commits need to be signed by using the [Developer’s Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/), which is the same mechanism that the Linux® Kernel and many other communities use to manage code contributions. You need to add a `Signed-off-by` line as a part of the commit message. Here is an example `Signed-off-by` line, which indicates that the submitter accepts the DCO:

```Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@hisdomain.com>```

You can find more information about DCO signoff in the [zlc repo](https://github.com/zowe/zlc/edit/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

## Report security issues

Please direct all security issues to `zowe-security@lists.openmainframeproject.org`. A member of the security team will reply to acknowledge receipt of the vulnerability and coordinate remediation with the affected project.
