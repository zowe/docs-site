### Vulnerabilities fixed

Zowe discloses the vulnerabilities in a timely manner but giving the user time to upgrade. The fixed vulnerabilities will be available on the Zowe security page. Zowe won't disclose the vulnerabilities that are fixed in the latest release as we respect the need for at least 45 days to decide when and how users will upgrade Zowe.
