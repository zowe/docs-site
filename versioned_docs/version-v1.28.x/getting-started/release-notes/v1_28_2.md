## Bug fixes

### Zowe installation and packaging

- Use of DVIPA may cause Zowe to believe that a port is not free when it is. Starting in this release, Zowe can narrow its port validation to a specific IP via `$ZWE_NETWORK_VIPA_IP=some.ip` or bypass the verification via `$ZWE_NETWORK_VALIDATE_PORT_FREE=false`. Setting this to false will still cause the servers to be unable to connect if the port is not free, but this can be a more accurate and portable setting.

### API Mediation Layer

- Use the `APIML_SECURITY_X509_ENABLED` flag to properly disable client certificate authentication for SSO. ([#2645](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2645)) ([5f32c09](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/commit/5f32c09))
- Enable Strict Transport Security HTTP on the Gateway service as the default. ([#2575](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2552)) ([decf6fe](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/commit/decf6fe))
