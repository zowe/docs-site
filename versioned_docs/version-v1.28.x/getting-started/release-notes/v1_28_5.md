### Zowe CLI

#### Zowe CLI (Core)

- Updated Imperative to version `4.18.19` to fix issues with normalizing newlines on file uploads, use `@zowe/secrets-for-zowe-sdk` as the default credential manager, and update the semver transitive dependency for technical currency. ([#1815](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1815))
