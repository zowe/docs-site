# Raising a CLI issue on GitHub

When necessary, raise a GitHub issue in the [Zowe&trade; CLI repository](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues). It is suggested that you use either the bug or enhancement template.

## Raising a bug report

Please provide as much of the information listed on [Troubleshooting CLI](troubleshoot-cli.md) as is reasonable. Anyone working on the issue might need to request this and other information if it is not supplied initially. A description of the error and how it can be reproduced is the most important information.

## Raising an enhancement report

Enhancement reports are just as important to the Zowe project as bug reports. Enhancement reports should be clear and detailed requirements for a potential enhancement.
