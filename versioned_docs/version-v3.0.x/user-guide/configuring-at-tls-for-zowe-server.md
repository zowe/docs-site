# Configuring AT-TLS for Zowe Server

You can configure parameters in the Zowe server to enable Zowe to work with AT-TLS. Review this article for information about AT-TLS inbound and outbound rules, and the required configuration to use AT-TLS in high availability. You can also find troubleshooting tips as well as security recommendations.

## AT-TLS configuration for Zowe

Follow these steps to configure Zowe to support AT-TLS:

```yaml
zowe:
    network:
        # For inbound traffic rules:
        server:
            tls:
                attls: true
        # If outbound traffic rules will be configured:
        client:
          tls:
            attls: true
```

While the Zowe Server components do not handle TLS on its own with AT-TLS enabled, the API Mediation Layer (API ML) requires information about the server certificate that is defined in the AT-TLS rule. Ensure that the server certificates provided by the AT-TLS layer are trusted in the configured Zowe keyring. We strongly recommend that AT-TLS be configured with the same Zowe keyring.

:::note Notes

- As the API ML Gateway is a core component of API ML, other components that need to interact with the Gateway, such as Zowe ZLUX App Server, also require AT-TLS configuration.

- Do not set `attls: true` together with `minTls` or `maxTls`. Zowe does not handle TLS in AT-TLS aware mode.

:::

:::caution Important security consideration

Configuring AT-TLS for Zowe requires careful consideration of security settings. These security settings apply to the Client Certificate authentication feature in Zowe API Mediation Layer components, as well as for onboarded services that support the x.509 client certificates authentication scheme.

Outbound AT-TLS rules (i.e. to make a transparent https call through http) that are configured to send the server certificate should be limited to the services that __require__ service to service authentication. If an API ML-onboarded southbound service needs to support X.509 client certificate authentication, we recommend to use the integrated TLS handshake capabilities of API ML. Do not configure an outbound AT-TLS rule for these services.

The Discovery Service endpoints are not reachable by standard API Gateway routing by default.

Zowe v3 includes a new component named ZAAS (Zowe Authentication and Authorization Service). In AT-TLS-aware mode, calls to this service are all internal between API ML components. These must include the X.509 Client Certificate.
:::

### Limitations

If using AT-TLS with a z/OS Keyring backed by an ICSF hardware module, the only supported configuration is Zowe with z/OSMF authentication provider in JWT mode.
A LTPA token and SAF provider cannot be used in this configuration because API ML cannot access the hardware key to sign its own tokens.
Personal Access Tokens (PAT) are not supported in this configuration because API ML cannot access the hardware key to sign the tokens.

## AT-TLS rules

This section describes suggested AT-TLS settings, and serves as guidelines to set your AT-TLS rules.

### Inbound rules

A generic inbound rule can be set for all Zowe services:

```bash
TTLSRule ZoweServerRule
{
  LocalAddr All
  RemoteAddr All
  LocalPortRange 7551-7559 # Range covers all Zowe services
  Jobname ZWE1* # Jobname according to zowe.job.prefix in zowe.yaml
  Direction Inbound
  TTLSGroupActionRef ServerGroupAction
  TTLSEnvironmentActionRef ZoweServerEnvironmentAction
  TTLSConnectionActionRef ZoweServerConnectionAction
}

TTLSGroupAction ServerGroupAction
{
  TTLSEnabled On
}

TTLSEnvironmentAction ZoweServerEnvironmentAction
{
  HandshakeRole ServerWithClientAuth
  EnvironmentUserInstance 0
  TTLSEnvironmentAdvancedParmsRef ServerEnvironmentAdvParms
  TTLSKeyringParmsRef ZoweKeyring
}

TTLSConnectionAction ZoweServerConnectionAction
{
  HandshakeRole ServerWithClientAuth
  TTLSCipherParmsRef CipherParms
  TTLSConnectionAdvancedParmsRef ZoweConnectionAdvParms
}

TTLSConnectionAdvancedParms ZoweConnectionAdvParms
{
  ApplicationControlled Off
  ServerCertificateLabel apimlcert # Specify the personal server certificate used for the Zowe Server
  CertificateLabel apimlcert # Specify the personal server certificate used for the Zowe Server
  SecondaryMap Off
}

# Keyring, used for TLS, will be used also to load trusted certificates
TTLSKeyringParms ZoweKeyring
{
  Keyring ZWEKRNG
}
```

The `PortRange` of this inbound rule is taken from the list of API Mediation Layer components in the `zowe.yaml` file. The `PortRange` should cover the following components:

| Component | Default Port |
|----|-----------------------|
| Gateway | 7554 |
| Discovery | 7553 |
| Caching Service | 7555 |
| API Catalog | 7552 |
| ZAAS | 7558 |
| Zowe System Services (ZSS) | 7557 |
| Zowe Application Server | 7556 |

**Follow this step:**

Replace `ZoweKeyring` with the keyring configured for your installation. Follow [the SAF keyring instructions](../getting-started/zowe-certificates-overview.md#saf-keyring) in the article _Zowe Certificates overview_ to configure keyrings for your Zowe instance.

Note the setting `HandshakeRole`. This setting applies to core services which authenticate through certificates with each other. This setting allows the API Gateway to receive and accept X.509 client certificates from API Clients.

For more granularity in the AT-TLS rules, separate the rules that need to support Client Certificate authentication (Discovery Service, Gateway Service) from the rules that do not need to support Client Certificate authentication(for example a rule covering API Gateway to an onboarded service).

### Outbound rules

Outbound rules in this section allow Zowe services to communicate with each other and to other southbound services using HTTP.

:::caution Important:
Careful consideration needs to be made regarding which rules are to be configured to send a Client Certificate. Since configuration cannot be performed on a per-request basis, it is essential not to configure the rule to send the Zowe Server certificate to the API Gateway or to a southbound service that supports X.509 Client Certificate authentication. Doing so will result in unintentionally authenticating the server ACID.

:::

**Example:**

```yaml
TTLSConnectionAction ClientConnectionAction  
{  
  HandshakeRole Client  
  TTLSCipherParmsRef CipherParms  
  TTLSConnectionAdvancedParmsRef ConnectionAdvancedParms  
  CertificateLabel  
}
```

#### For z/OSMF

This example rule covers the connection between the API Gateway and the z/OSMF instance. This connection is made to authenticate users in z/OS.

If `zowe.network.client.tls.attls` is `true`, this rule is assumed set. The requests to z/OSMF are issued using `http`.

```bash
TTLSRule ApimlZosmfClientRule
{
  LocalAddr All
  LocalPortRange 1024-65535 # Using any outbound port
  RemoteAddr All
  RemotePortRange 449 # Set to z/OSMF port
  Jobname ZWE1AZ* # Generate according to zowe.job.prefix in zowe.yaml + AZ for ZAAS outbound
  Direction Outbound
  TTLSGroupActionRef ClientGroupAction
  TTLSEnvironmentActionRef ApimlClientEnvironmentAction
  TTLSConnectionActionRef ApimlNoX509ClientConnAction # No X.509 Client Certificate required
}

TTLSGroupAction ClientGroupAction
{
  TTLSEnabled ON
}

TTLSEnvironmentAction ApimlClientEnvironmentAction
{
  HandshakeRole Client
  TTLSKeyringParmsRef ApimlKeyring
  TTLSCipherParmsRef CipherParms
  TTLSEnvironmentAdvancedParmsRef ClientEnvironmentAdvParms
}
```

:::note
`Jobname` is defined explicitly for the ZAAS component and is formed with the `zowe.job.prefix` setting from `zowe.yaml` plus `AZ` as the ZAAS identifier.
:::

#### For communication between API Gateway and other core services

Use the example in this section as a template for internal connections between API Mediation Layer core services.

:::caution Important

The outbound connection from the Gateway Service to the Discovery Service must be configured without a `CertificateLabel`. Ensure that the certificate label is not included (but keep the `CertificateLabel` field) to avoid sending the certificate in case routing would be possible to the Discovery Service. Note that this route is disabled by default.

:::

```bash
TTLSRule ApimlClientRule
{
  LocalAddr All
  LocalPortRange 1024-65535
  RemoteAddr All
  RemotePortRange 7551-7555 # Range covers API ML services (gateway, zaas, discovery, api catalog, caching service)
  Jobname ZWE1A* # Generate according to zowe.job.prefix in zowe.yaml
  Direction Outbound
  TTLSGroupActionRef ClientGroupAction
  TTLSEnvironmentActionRef ApimlClientEnvironmentAction
  TTLSConnectionActionRef ApimlX509ClientConnAction # X.509 Authentication is required in cross-service API ML communication
}

TTLSConnectionAction ApimlX509ClientConnAction
{
  HandshakeRole Client
  TTLSCipherParmsRef CipherParms
  TTLSConnectionAdvancedParmsRef ApimlClientX509ConnAdvParms
}

TTLSConnectionAdvancedParms ApimlClientX509ConnAdvParms
{
  ApplicationControlled Off
  CertificateLabel Zowe Server
  SecondaryMap Off
}
```

#### For communication between API Gateway and southbound services

In this example, the rule covers all outbound connections originating from the API Gateway to an example southbound service listening on port 8080.
This rule applies for Zowe services as well, such as the ZSS and app-server if they are enabled.

This example covers routing scenarios.

```bash
TTLSRule ApimlServiceClientRule
{
  LocalAddr All
  LocalPortRange 1024-65535
  RemoteAddr All
  RemotePortRange 8080 # Set to range of ports where services are listening
  Jobname ZWE1AG* # Generate according to zowe.job.prefix in zowe.yaml
  Direction Outbound
  TTLSGroupActionRef ClientGroupAction
  TTLSEnvironmentActionRef ApimlClientEnvironmentAction
  TTLSConnectionActionRef ApimlNoX509ClientConnAction # Do not send X.509 Client Certificates
}

TTLSConnectionAction ApimlNoX509ClientConnAction
{
  HandshakeRole Client
  TTLSCipherParmsRef CipherParms
  TTLSConnectionAdvancedParmsRef ApimlClientNoX509ConnAdvParms
}

TTLSConnectionAdvancedParms ApimlClientNoX509ConnAdvParms
{
  ApplicationControlled Off
  CertificateLabel # Leave empty to avoid sending a client certificate (i.e. if the keyring has a default certificate)
  SecondaryMap Off
}
```

:::caution Important

Outbound connections from the Gateway to southbound services (onboarded services) must not send the server certificate if the service accepts X.509 Client Certificate authentication. If the server certificate is sent, the server user is subsequently authenticated.

:::

#### Services that validate tokens against the API Mediation Layer

In this scenario, the services issue a request against the API Gateway to validate the received authentication token.

This scenario includes services that set `zoweJwt` as the authentication scheme, those that require an Open ID Connect (OIDC) token, or forwarded X.509 certificates.

In this case, it is necessary to have an Outbound rule from the service to the API Gateway.

These service also already have an outbound rule set for the onboarding process against the Discovery Service.

Ensure these rules are followed:

- Outbound rule to Discovery Service: Sends X.509 Client Certificate to authorize the onboarding.
- Outbound rule to API Gateway: __Do not__ set a Client Certificate.

### Ciphers

:::note
This list of ciphers is provided as an example only. Actual ciphers should be customized according to your specific configuration.
:::

The list of supported ciphers should be constructed according to the TLS supported versions.
Ensure that the cipher list has matches with non-AT-TLS-aware clients.

## Using AT-TLS for API ML in High Availability

AT-TLS settings for a Zowe installation configured in High Availability mode do not differ extensively. Changes need to be made to the previously described rules to allow for cross-lpar communication:

Ensure that the `RemoteAddr` setting in the rules accounts for the following connections:

- Discovery Service to Discovery Service. This is the replica request.
- Gateway Service to southbound services (including app-server and ZSS) running in another LPAR.
- Gateway Service to ZAAS running in another LPAR.
- Southbound services to Discovery Service. This applies during onboarding.
- All outbound connections need to account for all LPARs including the same where the rules are applied.

## Multi-tenancy deployment

For a specific scenario when Central API ML is running on z/OS with AT-TLS enabled, it is important to override the protocol for the external URL. This information is used by the Central API ML to call domain API ML and needs to reflect the outbound AT-TLS rule. In this case, update your domain API ML configuration:

```yaml
zowe:
  components:
    gateway:
      apiml:
        gateway:
          externalProtocol: http
```

## AT-TLS Troubleshooting

This section describes some common issues when using AT-TLS with Zowe and how to resolve these issues.

### The message `This combination of port requires SSL` is thrown when accesing an API ML service through a Browser

Make sure the URL starts with `https://`. This message indicates that AT-TLS rules are in place and it is trying to connect on an unsecured port to the API Gateway, however the latter is still only listening on a application-controlled secured port.

**Solution:**
Review settings in the API Gateway. Ensure that the changes described in [AT-TLS configuration for Zowe](#at-tls-configuration-for-zowe) are applied.

### AT-TLS rules are not applied

If the application is responding in http, the application may not be properly configured to support http-only calls. AT-TLS is not correctly configured.

**Solution:**

Ensure the rules are active and that the filters on port range and job names are properly set.

### Non matching ciphers / protocols

An error can occur if the [list of ciphers](#ciphers) or the TLS protocol does not match between the ones configured in the AT-TLS rules and the ones used by non AT-TLS-aware clients.

**Solution:**
Review the supported TLS versions and ciphers used in both the client and the server.

### Additional troubleshooting

When asking for support make sure to follow IBM guides for troubleshooting AT-TLS problems. This is covered in the "Diagnosing Application Transparent Transport Layer Security (AT-TLS)" article on IBM documentation.

Ensure you collect the logs and current configurations when contacting support.

## Full example of AT-TLS configuration
