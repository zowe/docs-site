# Dataservices

Dataservices are a dynamic component of the backend of a Zowe application. Dataservices are optional, because the proxy server might only serve static content for a particular application. However, when included in an application, a dataservice defines a URL space for which the server will run the extensible code from the application. Dataservices are primarily intended to be used to create REST APIs and Websocket channels.

## Defining a dataservice

Within the `sample-app` repository, in the top directory, you will find a `pluginDefinition.json` file. Each application requires this file, because it defines how the server registers and uses the backend of an application (called a plug-in in the terminology of the proxy server).

Within the JSON file, there is a top level attribute, *dataServices*:
```
  "dataServices": [
    {
      "type": "router",
      "name": "hello",
      "serviceLookupMethod": "external",
      "fileName": "helloWorld.js",
      "routerFactory": "helloWorldRouter",
      "dependenciesIncluded": true
    }
  ]
```
### Dataservices defined in pluginDefinition

The following attributes are valid for each dataservice in the *dataServices* array:

 **type**

 Specify one of the following values:

  - **router**: Router dataservices are dataservices that run under the proxy server, and use ExpressJS Routers for attaching actions to URLs and methods.

  - **service**: Service dataservices are dataservices that run under ZSS, and utilize the API of ZSS dataservices for attaching actions to URLs and methods.

**name**

 The name of the service that must be unique for each `pluginDefinition.json` file. The name is used to reference the dataservice during logging and it is also is used in the construction of the URL space that the dataservice occupies.

**serviceLookupMethod**

 Specify `external` unless otherwise instructed.

**fileName**

The name of the file that is the entry point for construction of the dataservice, relative to the application's `/lib` directory. In the case of `sample-app`, upon transpilation of the typescript code, javascript files are placed into the `/lib` directory.

**routerFactory (Optional)**

 When you use a router dataservice, the dataservice is included in the proxy server through a `require()` statement. If the dataservice's exports are defined such that the router is provided through a factory of a specific name, you must state the name of the exported factory using this attribute.

**dependenciesIncluded**

 Must be `true` for anything in the `pluginDefinition.json` file. (This setting is false only when adding dataservices to the server dynamically.)

## Dataservice API

The API for a dataservice can be categorized as Router-based or ZSS-based, and Websocket or not.

**Note:** Each Router dataservice can safely import express, express-ws, and bluebird without requiring the modules to be present, because these modules exist in the proxy server's directory and the *NODE_MODULES* environment variable can include this directory.

### Router-based dataservices


#### HTTP/REST router dataservices

Router-based dataservices must return a (bluebird) Promise that resolves to an ExpressJS router upon success. For more information, see the ExpressJS guide on use of Router middleware: [Using Router Middleware](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware#middleware.router).

Because of the nature of Router middleware, the dataservice need only specify URLs that stem from a root '/' path, as the paths specified in the router are later prepended with the unique URL space of the dataservice.

The Promise for the Router can be within a Factory export function, as mentioned in the `pluginDefinition` specification for *routerFactory* above, or by the module constructor.

An example is available in `sample-app/nodeServer/ts/helloWorld.ts`

#### Websocket router dataservices

ExpressJS routers are fairly flexible, so the contract to create the Router for Websockets is not significantly different.

Here, the express-ws package is used, which adds websockets through the ws package to ExpressJS. The two changes between a websocket-based router and a normal router are that the method is 'ws', as in `router.ws(<url>,<callback>)`, and  the callback provides the websocket on which you must define event listeners.

See the ws and express-ws topics on [www.npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) for more information about how they work, as the API for websocket router dataservices is primarily provided in these packages.

An example is available in `zlux-server-framework/plugins/terminal-proxy/lib/terminalProxy.js`

#### Router dataservice context

Every router-based dataservice is provided with a `Context` object upon creation that provides definitions of its surroundings and the functions that are helpful. The following items are present in the `Context` object:

**serviceDefinition**

The dataservice definition, originally from the `pluginDefinition.json` file within a plug-in.

**serviceConfiguration**

An object that contains the contents of configuration files, if present.

**logger**

An instance of a Zowe Logger, which has its component name as the unique name of the dataservice within a plug-in.

**makeSublogger**

A function to create a Zowe Logger with a new name, which is appended to the unique name of the dataservice.

**addBodyParseMiddleware**

A function that provides common body parsers for HTTP bodies, such as JSON and plaintext.

**plugin**

An object that contains more context from the plug-in scope, including:

- **pluginDef**: The contents of the `pluginDefinition.json` file that contains this dataservice.

- **server**: An object that contains information about the server's configuration such as:

    - **app**: Information about the product, which includes the *productCode* (for example: `ZLUX`).

    - **user**: Configuration information of the server, such as the port on which it is listening.
