After you install the Zowe Intellij plug-in, you must create a z/OSMF connection to your mainframe and some working sets. 

:::note

z/OS v2.1 or later is required z/OSMF configuration. The plug-in is in active development state.

## Creating z/OSMF connection 

There are two ways to create a z/OSMF connection: 
- using the in-built plug-in feature
- using Zowe Config v2

### Creating the connection using the plug-in feature

You can create a z/OSMF connection to your mainframe either by manually specifying all the needed information through the Settings tab, or by clicking the "+" sign. The z/OSMF port should be specified at the end of the address.

To create the connection:
1. In Zowe Explorer click **+** button
2. Select **Connection**
3. Type in all the necessary information
4. Wait until the connection is tested
