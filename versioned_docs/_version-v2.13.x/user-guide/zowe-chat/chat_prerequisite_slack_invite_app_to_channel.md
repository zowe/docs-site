# Adding your bot user to your Slack channel

You can add the bot user that you created to your Slack channel in two ways: either mention your bot user directly in the message field or click the link **Add an app** at the beginning of your channel.

## Mention your bot user directly 

You can mention your bot user directly in the message field.

1. Select the channel where you want to invite your Slack App.

2. In the message field, type @ and select the bot name you created, for example, bnz. You can see a **not in channel** notice behind it.

3. Send the message to the channel. You will receive a message from Slackbot to help you invite your bot user to this channel. Click **Invite Them**.
