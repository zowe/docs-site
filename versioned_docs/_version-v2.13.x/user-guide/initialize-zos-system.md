# Configuring Zowe with `zwe init`

Once you complete the installation of the Zowe runtime, begin configuration by initializing Zowe with proper security configurations. To simplify this configuration process, one option is to run the `zwe init` command. This step is common for installing and configuring Zowe from either a convenience build or from an SMP/E build.

## About the `zwe init` command

The `zwe init` command is a combination of the following subcommands. Each subcommand defines a configuration. 

- **mvs**  
Copies the data sets provided with Zowe to custom data sets.
- **security**  
Creates the user IDs and security manager settings.
- **apfauth**  
APF authorizes the LOADLIB containing the modules that need to perform z/OS privileged security calls. 
- **certificate**  
Configures Zowe to use TLS certificates.
- **vsam**  
Configures the VSAM files needed to run the Zowe caching service used for high availability (HA)
- **stc**  
Configures the system to launch the Zowe started task.

:::info::Recommendation:**
We recommend you to run these sub commands one by one to clearly see the output of each step. To successfully run `zwe init security`, `zwe init apfauth`, and `zwe init certificate`, it is likely that your organization requires elevated permissions. We recommend you consult with your security administrator to run these commands. For more information about tasks for the security administrator, see the section [Configuring security](./configuring-security) in this configuration documentation.

## zwe init arguments

The following `zwe init` arguments can assist you with the initization process:

- **--update-config**  
 This argument allows the init process to update your configuration file based on automatic detection and your `zowe.setup` settings. For example, if `java.home` and `node.home` are not defined, they can be updated based on the information that is collected on the system. `zowe.certificate` section can also be updated automatically based on your `zowe.setup.certificate` settings.
- **--allow-overwrite**  
 This argument allows you to rerun the `zwe init` command repeatedly regardless of whether some data sets are already created.
- **-v** or **--verbose**  
   This argument provides execution details of the `zwe` command. You can use it for troubleshooting purposes if the error message is not clear enough.
- **T-vv** or **--trace**  
 This argument provides you more execution details than the `--verbose` mode for troubleshooting purposes.

## Zowe initilization command

The `zwe init` command runs the subcommands in sequence automatically. If you have the Zowe configuration file preparted and have security administrator privileges, or security and certificates setup was already completed on the system, you can run the following command:

```
zwe init --config /path/to/zowe.yaml
```

:::note
Output from the execution of this command indicates the command ran successfully. However, to determine if each of the subcommands ran successfully, check the full output log. Failed execution of some subcommands may be the result of insufficient user permissions. Consult with your security administrator to find out if elevated permissions are required to successfully execute some of the `zwe init` subcommands.

## Next step

After all `zwe init` subcommands are successfully executed, the next step is to [configure the z/OS system for Zowe](./configure-zos-system).

For detailed information about individual `zwe init` subcommands, see [zwe init subcommand overview](./zwe-init-subcommand-overview.md).
