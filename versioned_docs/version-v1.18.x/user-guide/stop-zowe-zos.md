# Stopping the ZWESVSTC PROC

To stop the Zowe server, the ZWESVSTC PROC needs to be ended. Run the `zowe-stop.sh` script at the Unix Systems Services command prompt that is in the zowe instance directory used to start the Zowe started task:

```
cd $ZOWE_INSTANCE_DIR/bin
./zowe-stop.sh
```
where _<ZOWE_INSTANCE_DIR>_ is the directory where you set the instance directory to.

When you stop ZWESVSTC, you might get the following error message:

```
IEE842I ZWESVSTC DUPLICATE NAME FOUND- REENTER COMMAND WITH 'A='
```

This error results when there is more than one started task named ZWESVSTC. To resolve the issue, stop the required ZWESVSTC instance by issuing the following commands:

```
/C ${ZOWE_PREFIX}${ZOWE_INSTANCE}SV,A=asid
```
Where _ZOWE_PREFIX_ and _ZOWE_INSTANCE_ are specified in your configuration (and default to ZWE and 1) and you can obtain the _asid_ from the value of `A=asid` when you issue the following commands:

```
/D A,${ZOWE_PREFIX}${ZOWE_INSTANCE}SV
```
