**Featured topic:** Zowe Clients Team Configuration

**Featured speaker:** Adam Wolfe, OMP Ambassador and Broadcom Product Owner

With Zowe v3 on the release horizon, **team configuration** for **Zowe CLI** and **Zowe Explorer for Visual Studio Code** becomes more relevant than ever. The Zowe Community introduced *team config* to take the burden of learning, understanding, and implementing connectivity away from every user â€“ which is what v1 profiles required.

Join this session for a comprehensive review of team config, what it looks like, how best to leverage it, and (for those of you still using v1 profiles) best practices for converting Zowe CLI v1 profiles to team config to ensure you and your team are ready for Zowe v3!

## New delivery date for Zowe Version 3.0
