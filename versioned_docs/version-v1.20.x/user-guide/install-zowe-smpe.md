## Program support

This section describes the support available for Zowe.

Because this is an alpha release of the Zowe FMID package for early testing and adoption, no formal support is offered.  Support is available through the Zowe community.  See [Community Engagement](https://github.com/zowe/community/blob/master/README.md#communication-channels) for details. Slack is the preferred interaction channel.

Additional support may be available through other entities outside of the Open Mainframe Project and Linux Foundation which offers no warranty and provides the package under the terms of the EPL v2.0 license.

<!--TODO - Needs more legalese here-->

### Statement of support procedures

Report any problems which you feel might be an error in the product materials to the Zowe community via the Zowe GitHub community repo at [https://github.com/zowe/community/issues/new/choose](https://github.com/zowe/community/issues/new/choose). You may be asked to gather and submit additional diagnostics to assist the Zowe Community for analysis and resolution.

## Program and service level information

This section identifies the program and relevant service levels of Zowe. The program level refers to the APAR fixes that have been incorporated into the program. The service level refers to the PTFs that have been incorporated into the program.

### Program level information

All issues of previous releases of Zowe that were resolved before August 2019 have been incorporated into this packaging of Zowe.

### Service level information

The Zowe SMP/E package is a distribution of Zowe version 1.9.0 with an FMID of AZWE001.

Subsequent releases of the Zowe z/OS components are delivered as rollup PTFs on [zowe.org](https://www.zowe.org/download.html).  Because of the file size of the PTF, it is packaged as two co-requisite PTFs, which are made available in a single Zip file.

Zowe release | PTF 1 | PTF 2 
---|---|---
[1.10](https://zowe.jfrog.io/zowe/list/libs-release-local/org/zowe/download/legal.html?type=smpe&version=1.10.0) | UO01939 | UO01940
[1.11](https://zowe.jfrog.io/zowe/list/libs-release-local/org/zowe/download/legal.html?type=smpe&version=1.11.0) | UO01942 | UO01943
[1.12](https://zowe.jfrog.io/zowe/list/libs-release-local/org/zowe/download/legal.html?type=smpe&version=1.12.0) | UO01945 | UO01946
[1.13](https://zowe.jfrog.io/zowe/list/libs-release-local/org/zowe/download/legal.html?type=smpe&version=1.13.0) | UO01948 | UO01949

## Installation requirements and considerations

The following sections identify the system requirements for installing and activating Zowe.  The following terminology is used:

  * *Driving System:* the system on which SMP/E is executed to install the program.
  * *Target system:* the system on which the program is configured and run.

Use separate driving and target systems in the following situations:

  * When you install a new level of a product that is already installed, the new level of the product will replace the old one. By installing the new level onto a separate target system, you can test the new level and keep the old one in production at the same time.
<!--TODO - Is this standard nomenclature ?  Some customers won't have multiples to test with.  The above statement doesn't make sense. We need better separation of concerns ...  (@hogstrom) -->
  * When you install a product that shares libraries or load modules with other products, the installation can disrupt the other products. By installing the product onto a separate target system, you can assess these impacts without disrupting your production system.

### Driving system requirements

This section describes the environment of the driving system required to install Zowe.

#### Driving system machine requirements

The driving system can be run in any hardware environment that supports the required software.

#### Driving system programming requirements

Program Number| Product Name | Minimum VRM | Minimum Service Level will satisfy these APARs | Included in the shipped product?
---|---|---|---|---
5650-ZOS | z/OS | V2.2.0 or later | N/A | No 

**Notes:**
- SMP/E is a requirement for Installation and is an element of z/OS but can also be ordered as a separate product, 5655-G44, minimally V03.06.00.
- Installation might require migration to a new z/OS release to be service supported. See [https://www-01.ibm.com/software/support/lifecycle/index_z.html](https://www-01.ibm.com/software/support/lifecycle/index_z.html).

Zowe is installed into a file system, either HFS or zFS. Before installing Zowe, you must ensure that the target system file system data sets are available for processing on the driving system. OMVS must be active on the driving system and the target system file data sets must be mounted on the driving system.

If you plan to install Zowe in a zFS file system, this requires that zFS be active on the driving system. Information on activating and using zFS can be found in [z/OS Distributed File Service zSeries File System Administration](https://www.ibm.com/servers/resourcelink/svc00100.nsf/pages/zOSV2R3SC236887/$file/ioea700_v2r3.pdf) (SC24-5989).

### Target system requirements

This section describes the environment of the target system required to install and use Zowe.

Zowe installs in the z/OS (Z038) SREL.

#### Target system machine requirements

The target system can run in any hardware environment that supports the required software.

#### Target system programming requirements

**Installation requisites**  

Installation requisites identify products that are required and must be present on the system or products that are not required but should be present on the system for the successful installation of Zowe.

Mandatory installation requisites identify products that are required on the system for the successful installation of Zowe. These products are specified as PREs or REQs.

*Zowe has no mandatory installation requisites.*

Conditional installation requisites identify products that are not required for successful installation of Zowe but can resolve such things as certain warning messages at installation time. These products are specified as IF REQs.

*Zowe has no conditional installation requisites.*

**Operational requisites**  

Operational requisites are products that are required and must be present on the system, or, products that are not required but should be present on the system for Zowe to operate all or part of its functions.

Mandatory operational requisites identify products that are required for this product to operate its basic functions. The following table lists the target system mandatory operational requisites for Zowe.

Program Number |Product Name and Minimum VRM/Service Level
---|---
5650-ZOS |  IBM z/OS Management Facility V2.2.0 or higher
5655-SDK |	IBM SDK for Node.js - z/OS V8.16.0 or higher
5655-DGH |	IBM 64-bit SDK for z/OS Java Technology Edition V8.0.0

Conditional operational requisites identify products that are not required for Zowe to operate its basic functions but are required at run time for Zowe to operate specific functions. These products are specified as IF REQs. Zowe has no conditional operational requisites.

**Toleration/coexistence requisites**

Toleration/coexistence requisites identify products that must be present on sharing systems. These systems can be other systems in a multi-system environment (not necessarily Parallel Sysplex<sup>TM</sup>), a shared DASD environment (such as test and production), or systems that reuse the same DASD environment at different time intervals.

Zowe has no toleration/coexistence requisites.

**Incompatibility (negative) requisites**

Negative requisites identify products that must *not* be installed on the same system as Zowe.

Zowe has no negative requisites.

#### DASD storage requirements

Zowe libraries can reside on all supported DASD types.

**Total DASD space required by Zowe**

Library Type | Total Space Required in 3390 Trks | Description
---|---|---
Target |30 Tracks	| /
Distribution | 12030 Tracks	| /
File System(s) | 9000 Tracks | /
Web Download | 26111 Tracks | These are temporary data sets, which can be removed after the SMP/E install.

**Notes:**

  1. For non-RECFM U data sets, we recommend using system-determined block sizes for efficient DASD utilization. For RECFM U data sets, we recommend using a block size of 32760, which is most efficient from the performance and DASD utilization perspective.

  2. Abbreviations used for data set types are shown as follows.  
     - **U** - Unique data set, allocated by this product and used by only this product. This table provides all the required information to determine the correct storage for this data set. You do not need to refer to other tables or program directories for the data set size.
     - **S** - Shared data set, allocated by this product and used by this product and other products. To determine the correct storage needed for this data set, add the storage size given in this table to those given in other tables (perhaps in other program directories). If the data set already exists, it must have enough free space to accommodate the storage size given in this table.
     - **E** - Existing shared data set, used by this product and other products. This data set is not allocated by this product. To determine the correct storage for this data set, add the storage size given in this table to those given in other tables (perhaps in other program directories). If the data set already exists, it must have enough free space to accommodate the storage size given in this table.

      If you currently have a previous release of Zowe installed in these libraries, the installation of this release will delete the old release and reclaim the space that was used by the old release and any service that had been installed. You can determine whether these libraries have enough space by deleting the old release with a dummy function, compressing the libraries, and comparing the space requirements with the free space in the libraries.

      For more information about the names and sizes of the required data sets, see [Allocate SMP/E target and distribution libraries](#allocate-smp-e-target-and-distributions-libraries).

  3. Abbreviations used for the file system path type are as follows.

     - **N**	- New path, created by this product.
     - **X**	- Path created by this product, but might already exist from a previous release.
     - **P**	- Previously existing path, created by another product.

  4. All target and distribution libraries listed have the following attributes:

     * The default name of the data set can be changed.
     * The default block size of the data set can be changed.
     * The data set can be merged with another data set that has equivalent characteristics.
     * The data set can be either a PDS or a PDSE, with some exceptions. If the value in the "ORG" column specifies "PDS", the data set must be a PDS. If the value in "DIR Blks" column specifies "N/A", the data set must be a PDSE.

  5. All target libraries listed have the following attributes:

     * These data sets can be SMS-managed, but they are not required to be SMS-managed.
     * These data sets are not required to reside on the IPL volume.
     * The values in the "Member Type" column are not necessarily the actual SMP/E element types that are identified in the SMPMCS.

  6. All target libraries that are listed and contain load modules have the following attributes:

     * These data sets cannot be in the LPA, with some exceptions. If the value in the "Member Type" column specifies "LPA", it is advised to place the data set in the LPA.
     * These data sets can be in the LNKLST.
     * These data sets are not required to be APF-authorized, with some exceptions. If the value in the "Member Type" column specifies "APF", the data set must be APF-authorized.

**Storage requirements for SMP/E work data sets**

Library DDNAME | TYPE | ORG | RECFM | LRECL | No. of 3390 Trks | No. of DIR Blks
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
SMPWRK6 |	S	| PDS |	FB |80 | (20,200) |	50
SYSUT1 |U	| SEQ	| -- | --	| (20,200) | 0

In the table above, (20,200) specifies a primary allocation of 20 tracks, and a secondary allocation of 200 tracks.  

**Storage requirements for SMP/E data sets**

Library DDNAME | TYPE | ORG | RECFM | LRECL | No. of 3390 Trks | No. of DIR Blks
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
SMPPTS | S | PDSE | FB | 80 | (12000,3000) | 50

The following figures describe the target and distribution libraries and file system paths required to install Zowe. The storage requirements of Zowe must be added to the storage required by other programs that have data in the same library or path.

**Note:** Use the data in these tables to determine which libraries can be merged into common data sets. In addition, since some ALIAS names may not be unique, ensure that no naming conflicts will be introduced before merging libraries.

**Storage requirements for Zowe target libraries**

**Note:** These target libraries are not required for the initial FMID install of Zowe SMP/E but will be required for subsequent SYSMODS so are included here for future reference.

Library DDNAME | Member Type | Target Volume | Type | Org | RECFM | LRECL | No. of 3390 Trks | No. of DIR Blks
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
SZWEAUTH | APF Load Modules	| ANY | U | PDSE | U | 0 | 15 | N/A
SZWESAMP | Samples | ANY | U | PDSE | FB | 80 | 15 | 5

**Zowe file system paths**

DDNAME | TYPE | Path Name
---|---|---
SZWEZFS | X | /usr/lpp/zowe/SMPE

**Storage requirements for Zowe distribution libraries**

**Note:** These target libraries are not required for the initial alpha drop of Zowe SMP/E but will be required for subsequent drops so are included here for future reference.

Library DDNAME | TYPE | ORG | RECFM | LRECL | No. of 3390 Trks | No. of DIR Blks
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
AZWEAUTH | U | PDSE | U | 0 | 15 | N/A
AZWESAMP | U | PDSE | FB | 80 | 15 | 5
AZWEZFS | U | PDSE | VB | 6995 | 12000 | 30

The following figures list data sets that are not used by Zowe, but are required as input for SMP/E.

Data Set Name | TYPE | ORG | RECFM | LRECL | No. of 3390 Trks | No. of DIR Blks
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
hlq.ZOWE.AZWE001.F1 | U | PDSE | FB | 80 | 5 | N/A
hlq.ZOWE.AZWE001.F2 | U | PDSE | FB | 80 | 5 | N/A
hlq.ZOWE.AZWE001.F4 | U | PDSE | VB | 6995 | 9000 | N/A
hlq.ZOWE.AZWE001.SMPMCS | U | SEQ | FB | 80 | 1 | N/A
z/OS UNIX file system | U | zFS | N/A | N/A | 17095 | N/A

**Note:** These are temporary data sets, which can be removed after the SMP/E installation.

### FMIDs deleted

Installing Zowe might result in the deletion of other FMIDs. 

To see which FMIDs will be deleted, examine the `++VER` statement in the SMPMCS of the product. If you do not want to delete these FMIDs now, install Zowe into separate SMP/E target and distribution zones.

**Note:** These FMIDs are not automatically deleted from the Global Zone. If you want to delete these FMIDs from the Global Zone, use the SMP/E REJECT NOFMID DELETEFMID command. See the SMP/E Commands book for details.

**Special considerations**

Zowe has no special considerations for the target system.

## Installation instructions

This section describes the installation method and the step-by-step procedures to install and activate the functions of Zowe.

**Notes:**

* If you want to install Zowe into its own SMP/E environment, consult the SMP/E manuals for instructions on creating and initializing the SMPCSI and SMP/E control data sets.
* You can use the sample jobs that are provided to perform part or all of the installation tasks. The SMP/E jobs assume that all DDDEF entries that are required for SMP/E execution have been defined in appropriate zones.
* You can use the SMP/E dialogs instead of the sample jobs to accomplish the SMP/E installation steps.

### SMP/E considerations for installing Zowe

Use the SMP/E RECEIVE, APPLY, and ACCEPT commands to install this release of Zowe.

### SMP/E options subentry values

The recommended values for certain SMP/E CSI subentries are shown in the following table. Using values lower than the recommended values can result in failures in the installation. DSSPACE is a subentry in the GLOBAL options entry. PEMAX is a subentry of the GENERAL entry in the GLOBAL options entry. See the SMP/E manuals for instructions on updating the global zone.

Subentry | Value | Comment
---|---|---
DSSPACE | (1200,1200,1400)  | Space allocation
PEMAX | SMP/E Default | IBM recommends using the SMP/E default for PEMAX.

### Download the Zowe SMP/E package

To download the Zowe SMP/E package, open your web browser and go to the [Zowe Download](https://www.zowe.org/download.html) website. Click the **Zowe SMP/E FMID AZWE001** button to save the file to a folder on your desktop.

You will receive one ZIP package on your desktop. You can extract the following files from the package.

  - **AZWE001.pax.Z (binary)**

     The SMP/E input data sets to install Zowe are provided as compressed files in AZWE001.pax.Z. This pax archive file holds the SMP/E MCS and RELFILEs.

  - **AZWE001.readme.txt (text)**

     The README file AZWE001.readme.txt is a single JCL file containing a job with the job steps you need to begin the installation, including comprehensive comments on how to tailor them. There is a sample job step that executes the z/OS UNIX System Services pax command to extract package archives. This job also executes the GIMUNZIP program to expand the package archives so that the data sets can be processed by SMP/E.

     Review this file on your desktop and follow the instructions that apply to your system.

### Allocate file system to hold the download package

You can either create a new z/OS UNIX file system (zFS) or create a new directory in an existing file system to place AZWE001.pax.Z. The directory that will contain the download package must reside on the z/OS system where the function will be installed.

To create a new file system, and directory, for the download package, you can use the following sample JCL (FILESYS).

Copy and paste the sample JCL into a separate data set, uncomment the job, and modify the job to update required parameters before submitting it.

```

### Upload the download package to the host

Upload the AZWE001.readme.txt file in text format and the AZWE001.pax.Z file in binary format from your workstation to the z/OS UNIX file system. The instructions in this section are also in the AZWE001.readme.txt file that you downloaded.

There are many ways to transfer the files or make them available to the z/OS system where the package will be installed. In the following sample dialog, we use FTP from a Microsoft Windows command line to do the transfer. This assumes that the z/OS host is configured as an FTP host/server and that the workstation is an FTP client.  Commands or other information entered by the user are in bold, and the following values are assumed.

User enters: | Values 
---|---
mvsaddr | TCP/IP address or hostname of the z/OS system
tsouid | Your TSO user ID
tsopw | Your TSO password
d: | Location of the downloaded files
@zfs_path@ | z/OS UNIX path where to store the files. This matches the @zfs_path@ variable you specified in the previous step.

**Important!**  The AZWE001.pax.Z file must be uploaded to the z/OS driving system in binary format, or the subsequent UNPAX step will fail.

Sample FTP upload scenario:

```
C:/>ftp mvsaddr  
Connected to mvsaddr. 
200-FTPD1 IBM FTP CS %version% at mvsaddr, %time% on %date%.
220 Connection will close if idle for more than 5 minutes.  
User (mvsaddr:(none)): tsouid  
331 Send password please  
Password: tsopw  
230 tsouid is loaded on.  Working directory is "tsouid.".

250 Transfer completed successfully.  
ftp: 524192256 bytes sent in 1.26 sec. (1040.52 Kbs)  
ftp: quit  
221 Quit command received.  Goodbye.  
```

**If you are unable to connect with ftp and only able to use sftp**,
the commands above are the same except that you will use _sftp_ at the command prompt instead of _ftp_. Also, because _sftp_ only supports binary file transfer, the ___ascii___ and ___binary___ commands should be omitted. After you transfer the AZWE001.readme.txt file, it will be in an ASCII codepage so you need to convert it to EBCDIC before it can be used. To convert AZWE001.readme.txt to EBCDIC, log in to the distribution system using ssh and run an ICONV command.

_C:>/__ssh tsouid@mvsaddr___   
_tsouid@mvsaddr's password: __tsopw___  
_/u/tsouid:>_  
_cd:@zfs_path@_  
_@zfs_path:>_  
_@zfs_path:>iconv -f ISO8859-1 -t IBM-1047 AZWE001.readme.txt > AZWE001.readme.EBCDIC_  
_@zfs_path:>rm AZWE001.readme.txt_  
_@zfs_path:>mv AZWE001.readme.EBCDIC AZWE001.readme.txt_  
_@zfs_path:>exit_  
_C:>/_  

### Extract and expand the compressed SMPMCS and RELFILEs

The AZWE001.readme.txt file uploaded in the previous step holds a sample JCL to expand the compressed SMPMCS and RELFILEs from the uploaded AZWE001.pax.Z file into data sets for use by the SMP/E RECEIVE job. The JCL is repeated here for your convenience.

* _@zfs_path@_ matches the variable that you specified in the previous step.
* If the `oshell` command gets a RC=256 and message "pax: checksum error on tape (got ee2e, expected 0)", then the archive file was not uploaded to the host in binary format.
* GIMUNZIP allocates data sets to match the definitions of the original data sets. You might encounter errors if your SMS ACS routines alter the attributes used by GIMUNZIP. If this occurs, specify a non-SMS managed volume for the GINUMZIP allocation of the data sets. For example:
  ```
  storclas-"storage_class" volume="data_set_volume"  
  newname-"..."/>
	```
* Normally, your Automatic Class Selection (ACS) routines decide which volumes to use.  Depending on your ACS configuration, and whether your system has constraints on disk space, units, or volumes, some supplied SMP/E jobs might fail due to volume allocation errors. See [GIMUNZIP](#gimunzip) for more details.

#### GIMUNZIP

The GIMUNZIP job may issue allocation error messages for SYSUT1 similar to these:  

```

```

The job will end with RC=12. If this happens, add a TEMPDS control statement to the existing SYSIN as shown below:

```
//SYSIN    DD *

//*                                 
```
where, `&VOLSER` is a DISK volume with sufficient free space to hold temporary copies of the RELFILES.  As a guide, this may require 1,000 cylinders, or about 650 MB.


### Sample installation jobs

The following sample installation jobs are provided in `hlq.ZOWE.AZWE001.F1`, or equivalent, as part of the project to help you install Zowe:

Job Name | Job Type | Description | RELFILE
---|---|---|---
ZWE1SMPE | SMP/E | Sample job to create an SMP/E environment (optional) | ZOWE.AZWE001.F1
ZWE2RCVE | RECEIVE | Sample SMP/E RECEIVE job  | ZOWE.AZWE001.F1
ZWE3ALOC | ALLOCATE | Sample job to allocate target and distribution libraries | ZOWE.AZWE001.F1
ZWE4ZFS | ALLOMZFS | Sample job to allocate, create mountpoint, and mount zFS data sets | ZOWE.AZWE001.F1
ZWE5MKD | MKDIR | Sample job to invoke the supplied ZWEMKDIR EXEC to allocate file system paths | ZOWE.AZWE001.F1
ZWE6DDEF | DDDEF | Sample job to  define SMP/E DDDEFs | ZOWE.AZWE001.F1
ZWE7APLY | APPLY | Sample SMP/E APPLY job | ZOWE.AZWE001.F1
ZWE8ACPT | ACCEPT | Sample SMP/E ACCEPT job | ZOWE.AZWE001.F1

**Note:** When Zowe is downloaded from the web, the RELFILE data set name will be prefixed by your chosen high-level qualifier, as documented in the [Extract and expand the compressed SMPMCS and RELFILEs](#extract-and-expand-the-compressed-smpmcs-and-relfiles) section.

You can access the sample installation jobs by performing an SMP/E RECEIVE (refer to [Perform SMP/E RECEIVE](#perform-smp-e-receive)), then copy the jobs from the RELFILES to a work data set for editing and submission.

You can also copy the sample installation jobs from the product files by submitting the following job.  Before you submit the job, add a job statement and change the lowercase parameters to uppercase values to meet the requirements of your site.

```
//STEP1    EXEC PGM=IEBCOPY
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//IN       DD DSN=ZOWE.AZWE001.F1,
//            DISP=SHR,
//*           VOL=SER=filevol,
//            UNIT=SYSALLDA
//OUT      DD DSNAME=jcl-library-name,
//            DISP=(NEW,CATLG,DELETE),
//            SPACE=(TRK,(5,5,5)),
//*           VOL=SER=dasdvol,
//            UNIT=SYSALLDA
//SYSUT3   DD UNIT=SYSALLDA,SPACE=(CYL,(1,1))
//SYSIN    DD *
    COPY INDD=IN,OUTDD=OUT
/*
```

See the following information to update the statements in the sample above:

- IN:   
   * __filevol__ is the volume serial of the DASD device where the downloaded files reside.

- OUT:  
  * __jcl-library-name__ is the name of the output data set where the sample jobs are stored.  
  * __dasdvol__ is the volume serial of the DASD device where the output data set resides. Uncomment the statement is a volume serial must be provided.  

The following supplied jobs might fail due to disk space allocation errors, as mentioned above for [GIMUNZIP](#gimunzip). Review the following sections for example error and actions that you can take to resolve the error.
- [ZWE2RCVE](#zwe2rcve)
- [ZWE1SMPE and ZWE4ZFS](#zwe1smpe-and-zwe4zfs)
- [ZWEMKDIR,  ZWE1SMPE, ZWE2RCVE, ZWE3ALOC,  ZWE4ZFS and ZWE5MKD](#zwemkdir-zwe1smpe-zwe2rcve-zwe3aloc-zwe4zfs-and-zwe5mkd)

ZOWE.SMPE.AZWE001.F4                                            
```
Add space and directory allocations to this SMPCNTL statement in the preceding ZWE1SMPE job:

```
ADD DDDEF(SMPTLIB)  UNIT(SYSALLDA) .  
```

This makes it as below:

```
ADD DDDEF(SMPTLIB) CYL SPACE(2,1) DIR(10)  UNIT(SYSALLDA) .  
```

#### ZWE1SMPE and ZWE4ZFS

Example error
```

Uncomment the `VOL=SER=&...` control statements and refer to the comments at the start of the JCL job for related necessary changes.
  

### Create SMP/E environment (Optional)

A sample job ZWE1SMPE is provided or you may choose to use your own JCL. If you are using an existing CSI, do not run the sample job ZWE1SMPE. If you choose to use the sample job provided, edit and submit ZWE1SMPE. Consult the instructions in the sample job for more information.

**Note:** If you want to use the default of letting your Automatic Class Selection (ACS) routines decide which volume to use, comment out the following line in the sample job ZWE1SMPE.

```// SET CSIVOL=#csivol```

__Expected Return Codes and Messages:__ You will receive a return code of 0 if this job runs correctly.

### Perform SMP/E RECEIVE

Edit and submit sample job ZWE2RCVE to perform the SMP/E RECEIVE for Zowe. Consult the instructions in the sample job for more information.

__Expected Return Codes and Messages:__ You will receive a return code of 0 if this job runs correctly.

### Allocate SMP/E target and distributions libraries

Edit and submit sample job ZWE3ALOC to allocate the SMP/E target and distribution libraries for Zowe. Consult the instructions in the sample job for more information.

__Expected Return Codes and Messages:__ You will receive a return code of 0 if this job runs correctly.

### Allocate, create and mount ZSF files (Optional)

This job allocates, creates a mountpoint, and mounts zFS data sets.

If you plan to install Zowe into a new z/OS UNIX file system, you can edit and submit the optional ZWE4ZFS job to perform the following tasks. Consult the instructions in the sample job for more information.

  * Create the z/OS UNIX file system
  * Create a mountpoint
  * Mount the z/OS UNIX file system on the mountpoint

The recommended z/OS UNIX file system type is zFS. The recommended mountpoint is _/usr/lpp/zowe._

Before running the sample job to create the z/OS UNIX file system, you must ensure that OMVS is active on the driving system. zFS must be active on the driving system if you are installing Zowe into a file system that is zFS.

If you create a new file system for this product, consider updating the BPXPRMxx PARMLIB member to mount the new file system at IPL time. This action can be helpful if an IPL occurs before the installation is completed.

```
MOUNT FILESYSTEM('#dsn')
 MOUNTPOINT('/usr/lpp/zowe')
 MODE(RDWR)        /* can be MODE(READ) */
 TYPE(ZFS) PARM('AGGRGROW') /* zFS, with extents */
```
See the following information to update the statements in the previous sample:

  * __#dsn__ is the name of the data set holding the z/OS UNIX file system.
  * ___/usr/lpp/zowe___ is the name of the mountpoint where the z/OS UNIX file system will be mounted.

__Expected Return Codes and Messages:__ You will receive a return code of 0 if this job runs correctly.

### Allocate z/OS UNIX paths

The target system HFS or zFS data set must be mounted on the driving system when running the sample ZWE5MKD job since the job will create paths in the HFS or zFS.

Before running the sample job to create the paths in the file system, you must ensure that OMVS is active on the driving system and that the target system's HFS or zFS file system is mounted on the driving system. zFS must be active on the driving system if you are installing Zowe into a file system that is zFS.

If you plan to install Zowe into a new HFS or zFS file system, you must create the mountpoint and mount the new file system on the driving system for Zowe.

<!--Should this be /usr/lpp/zowe/v1?-->

The recommended mountpoint is _/usr/lpp/zowe._

Edit and submit sample job ZWE5MKD to allocate the HFS or zFS paths for Zowe. Consult the instructions in the sample job for more information.

If you create a new file system for this product, consider updating the BPXPRMxx PARMLIB member to mount the new file system at IPL time. This action can be helpful if an IPL occurs before the installation is completed.

__Expected Return Codes and Messages:__ You will receive a return code of 0 if this job runs correctly.

### Create DDDEF entries

Edit and submit sample job ZWE6DDEF to create DDDEF entries for the SMP/E target and distribution libraries for Zowe. Consult the instructions in the sample job for more information.

__Expected Return Codes and Messages:__ You will receive a return code of 0 if this job runs correctly.

### Perform SMP/E APPLY

In this step, you run the sample job ZWE7APLY to apply Zowe. This step can take a long time to run, depending on the capacity of your system, and on what other jobs are running.

**Follow these steps**

1. Ensure that you have the latest HOLDDATA; then edit and submit sample job ZWE7APLY to perform an SMP/E APPLY CHECK for Zowe. Consult the instructions in the sample job for more information.

   The latest HOLDDATA is available through several different portals, including [http://service.software.ibm.com/holdata/390holddata.html](http://service.software.ibm.com/holdata/390holddata.html). The latest HOLDDATA may identify HIPER and FIXCAT APARs for the FMIDs you will be installing. An APPLY CHECK will help you determine whether any HIPER or FIXCAT APARs are applicable to the FMIDs you are installing. If there are any applicable HIPER of FIXCAT APARs, the APPLY CHECK will also identify fixing PTFs that will resolve the APARs, if a fixing PTF is available.

   You should install the FMIDs regardless of the status of unresolved HIPER or FIXCAT APARs. However, do not deploy the software until the unresolved HIPER and FIXCAT APARs have been analyzed to determine their applicability. That is, before deploying the software either ensure fixing PTFs are applied to resolve all HIPER or FIXCAT APARs, or ensure the problems reported by all HIPER or FIXCAT APARs are not applicable to your environment.

   To receive the full benefit of the SMP/E Causer SYSMOD Summary Report, do _not_ bypass the PRE, ID, REQ, and IFREQ on the APPLY CHECK. The SMP/E root cause analysis identifies the cause only of _errors_ and not of _warnings_ (SMP/E treats bypassed PRE, ID, REQ, and IFREQ conditions as warnings, instead of errors).

   Here are sample APPLY commands:

   1. To ensure that all recommended and critical service is installed with the FMIDs, receive the latest HOLDDATA and use the APPLY CHECK command as follows

    ```
    APPLY S(fmid,fmid,...) CHECK   
    FORFMID(fmid,fmid,...)
    SOURCEID(RSU*)
    FIXCAT(IBM.PRODUCTINSTALL-REQUIREDSERVICE)
    GROUPEXTEND .
    ```
    * Some HIPER APARs might not have fixing PTFs available yet.  You should analyze the symptom flags for the unresolved HIPER APARs to determine if the reported problem is applicable to your environment and if you should bypass the specific ERROR HOLDs in order to continue the installation of the FMIDs.
    * This method requires more initial research, but can provide resolution for all HPERs that have fixing PTFs available and not in a PE chain. Unresolved PEs or HIPERs might still exist and require the use of BYPASS.

   2. To install the FMIDs without regard for unresolved HIPER APARs, you can add the BYPASS(HOLDCLASS(HIPER)) operand to the APPLY CHECK command. This will allow you to install FMIDs, even though one of more unresolved HIPER APARs exist. After the FMIDs are installed, use the SMP/E REPORT ERRSYSMODS command to identify unresolved HIPER APARs and any fixing PTFs.

    ```
    APPLY S(fmid,fmid,...) CHECK
    FORFMID(fmid,fmid,...)
    SOURCEID(RSU*)
    FIXCAT(IBM.PRODUCTINSTALL-REQUIREDSERVICE)
    GROUPEXTEND
    BYPASS(HOLDCLASS(HIPER)) .
     ..any other parameters documented in the program directory
    ```
    * This method is quicker, but requires subsequent review of the Exception SYSMOD report produced by the REPORT ERRSYSMODS command to investigate any unresolved HIPERs. If you have received the latest HOLDDATA, you can also choose to use the REPORT MISSINGFIX command and specify Fix Category IBM.PRODUCTINSTALL-REQUIREDSERVICE to investigate missing recommended service.
    * If you bypass HOLDs during the installation of the FMIDs because fixing PTFs are not yet available, you can be notified when the fixing PTFs are available by using the APAR Status Tracking (AST) function of the ServiceLink or the APAR Tracking function of Resource Link.

2. After you take actions that are indicated by the APPLY CHECK, remove the CHECK operand and run the job again to perform the APPLY.

**Note:** The GROUPEXTENDED operand indicates the SMP/E applies all requisite SYSMODs. The requisite SYSMODS might be applicable to other functions.

**Expected Return Codes and Messages from APPLY CHECK:** You will receive a return code of 0 if the job runs correctly.

**Expected Return Codes and Messages from APPLY:** You will receive a return code of 0 if the job runs correctly.

### Perform SMP/E ACCEPT

Edit and submit sample job ZWE8ACPT to perform an SMP/E ACCEPT CHECK for Zowe. Consult the instructions in the sample job for more information.

To receive the full benefit of the SMP/E Causer SYSMOD Summary Report, do not bypass the PRE, ID, REQ, and IFREQ on the ACCEPT CHECK. The SMP/E root cause analysis identifies the cause of errors but not warnings (SMP/E treats bypassed PRE, ID, REQ, and IFREQ conditions as warnings rather than errors).

Before you use SMP/E to load new distribution libraries, it is recommended that you set the ACCJCLIN indicator in the distribution zone. In this way, you can save the entries that are produced from JCLIN in the distribution zone whenever a SYSMOD that contains inline JCLIN is accepted. For more information about the ACCJCLIN indicator, see the description of inline JCLIN in the SMP/E Commands book for details.

After you take actions that are indicated by the ACCEPT CHECK, remove the CHECK operand and run the job again to perform the ACCEPT.

**Note:** The GROUPEXTEND operand indicates that SMP/E accepts all requisite SYSMODs. The requisite SYSMODS might be applicable to other functions.

**Expected Return Codes and Messages from ACCEPT CHECK:** You will receive a return code of 0 if this job runs correctly.

If PTFs that contain replacement modules are accepted, SMP/E ACCEPT processing will link-edit or bind the modules into the distribution libraries. During this processing, the Linkage Editor or Binder might issue messages that indicate unresolved external references, which will result in a return code of 4 during the ACCEPT phase. You can ignore these messages, because the distribution libraries are not executable and the unresolved external references do not affect the executable system libraries.

**Expected Return Codes and Messages from ACCEPT:** You will receive a return code of 0 if this job runs correctly.

### Run REPORT CROSSZONE

The SMP/E REPORT CROSSZONE command identifies requisites for products that are installed in separate zones. This command also creates APPLY and ACCEPT commands in the SMPPUNCH data set. You can use the APPLY and ACCEPT commands to install those cross-zone requisites that the SMP/E REPORT CROSSZONE command identifies.

After you install Zowe, it is recommended that you run REPORT CROSSZONE against the new or updated target and distribution zones. REPORT CROSSZONE requires a global zone with ZONEINDEX entries that describe all the target and distribution libraries to be reported on.

For more information about REPORT CROSSZONE, see the SMP/E manuals.

### Cleaning up obsolete data sets, paths, and DDDEFs

The web download data sets listed in [DASD storage requirements](#dasd-storage-requirements) are temporary data sets. You can delete these data sets after you complete the SMP/E installation.

## Activating Zowe

### File system execution

If you mount the file system in which you have installed Zowe in read-only mode during execution, then you do not have to take further actions to activate Zowe.

## Zowe customization

You can find the necessary information about customizing and using Zowe on the Zowe doc site.

### SMP/E CALLLIBS Processing

Zowe uses the CALLLIBS function that is provided in SMP/E to resolve external references during installation. When Zowe is installed, ensure that DDDEFs exist for the following libraries:
<!--Needs a list of libraries-->
<!--
- CSSLIB
- DSNLOAD
- MACLIB
**Note:** CALLLIBS uses the previous DDDEFs only to resolve the link-edit for Zowe. These data sets are not updated during the installation of Zowe.
