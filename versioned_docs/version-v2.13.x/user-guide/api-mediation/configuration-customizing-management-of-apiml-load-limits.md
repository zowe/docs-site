# Customizing management of API ML load limits 

:::info Role: system programmer
::: 

As a system programmer, you can customize your configuration for how API ML manages both northbound and southbound load limits in single instances:

 * To change the number of concurrent connections per route passing through the API Gateway, see [Customizing connection limits](./configuration-connection-limits).

 * To change the global Gateway timeout value for the API ML instance, see [Customizing Gateway timeouts](./configuration-gateway-timeouts).

 * Also see the following properties in API Gateway configuration parameters: 
    * `server.maxTotalConnections`
    * `server.maxConnectionsPerRoute`
