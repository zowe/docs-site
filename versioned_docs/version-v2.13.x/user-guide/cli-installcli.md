After you install Zowe CLI and Zowe CLI plug-ins using your preferred installation method, see [Using CLI](../user-guide/cli-using-usingcli.md) to learn about how to connect Zowe CLI to the mainframe, create Zowe CLI profiles and team profiles, integrate Zowe CLI with API ML, enable daemon mode, and much, much more!

### Installation notes

- As you are installing Zowe CLI, you might encounter error messages that relate to `cpu-features` and `ssh`. You can safely ignore error messages of this type; the installation completes successfully. This behavior can occur when you install CLI from npm and from a local package.

## Prerequisites

- Meet the [software requirements](../user-guide/systemrequirements-cli.md) for Zowe CLI.
- Meet the [software requirements](../user-guide/cli-swreqplugins.md) for each plug-in.

### Prerequisite notes

- If you are installing Zowe CLI on a computer that is running Node.js 16 on a Windows operating system, see [Installing Zowe CLI with Node.js 16 on Windows](../user-guide/cli-install-cli-nodejs-windows.md).

- If you are running NPM version 7 (`npm@7`) or NPM version 8 (`npm@8`) on a Windows operating system, ensure that your computer is connected to the Internet.

   Issue the following command ***before*** you install Zowe CLI:

   ```
   npm install -g prebuild-install
   ```

- Linux users ***might*** need to prepend `sudo` to `npm` commands. For more information, see [Troubleshooting Zowe CLI](../troubleshoot/cli/troubleshoot-cli.md).


## Install Zowe CLI from npm
