### Zowe installation and packaging

* Added a new zwe `diagnose` command to get help on zowe error messages. ([#3455](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/3455))

### Zowe Application Framework

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

* The API Catalog now allows pre-defined style customizations. ([#2965](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/pull/2965)) 
#### Zlux App Server
* Migrated app-server configuration options into a `defaults.yaml` file which adheres to the schema of the Zowe config. This allows users to see the default behaviors more clearly and can serve as an example by which users can customize their Zowe config to override such defaults. ([#247](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/247))

#### Zlux Server Framework
* Avoid going directly to the Desktop when the gateway is active, by redirecting to the gateway equivalent homepage when the homepage is accessed. The redirect behavior can be prevented if desired by using the query parameter `?zwed-no-redirect=1` in your URL. ([#449](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/449))

#### Zowe Common C
* The `configmgr` can now use the `zos` module in YAML config templates. The `zos` module is only added when run on zOS. For a list of available functions, see [this link](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/blob/v2.x/staging/build/zwe/types/%40qjstypes/zos.d.ts). (#[384](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/384))

### Zowe CLI

#### Zowe CLI Imperative Framework

- Performed back-end preparation for the upcoming `ZOWE_V3_ERR_FORMAT` environment variable to enable the ability to display errors in a more reader-friendly format. ([Zowe CLI #935](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/935))

## Bug fixes

Zowe Version 2.10.0 contains the bug fixes that are described in the following topics.

### Zowe Application Framework
#### Zlux App Server
* Fixed the URLs that app-server would print in the logs describing where it was accessible from. Messages were incorrectly providing URLs indicating the app-serverâ€™s location from the discovery server instead of the gateway server. ([#247](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/pull/247))

#### Zlux App Manager
* Fixed a timing issue with the `iframe-adapter` for Firefox. ([#532](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-manager/pull/532))

#### ZSS
* Datasets with `VOLSER` set to an `MVS` symbol would cause dataset read, write, and metadata API calls to fail for those datasets. It is fixed now.([#603](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/603))
* Previously, the `zss/datasetMetadata` API could encounter an `0C9-09` error when accessing a dataset with 0 block size. This is fixed. Now it does not have an error while accessing such datasets. ([#606](https://github.com/zowe/zss/pull/606))

#### Zowe Common C
* `configmgr` parsing of `YAML` to `JSON` has been updated to 1024 characters to allow for up to max unix path strings. Earlier it was limited to 256 characters for strings. ([#383](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-common-c/pull/383)) 

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

* The client is provided with information about an expired password. ([c4dc217](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/commit/c4dc217), closes [#2969](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2969))

### Zowe CLI

#### Zowe CLI (Core)

- Fixed the `zowe files create data-set` command failing when no additional options are specified. ([#1736](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/1736))
- Added check for invalid block size when creating a sequential data set. ([#1439](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1439))
- Added the ability to list all data set members when some members have invalid names. ([#1730](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/1730))
- Removed extra calls to list data sets matching patterns if authentication to z/OSMF fails. ([#1731](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/1731), [Zowe Explorer #2262](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/issues/2262))

#### Zowe CLI Imperative Framework

- Enabled `NextVerFeatures.useV3ErrFormat()` to form the right environment variable name even if `Imperative.init()` has not been called. ([Zowe CLI #935](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/935))

- Handle logic for if a null command handler is provided. ([#990](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/pull/990))
