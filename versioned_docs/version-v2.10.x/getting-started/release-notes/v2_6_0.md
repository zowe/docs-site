## Bug fixes

### Zowe installation and packaging

- When a component configure script failed during startup, no warning would be printed. Starting in 2.6, a warning will be printed and there's also an option to prevent Zowe from continuing startup when this failure is seen, by setting `zowe.launchScript.onComponentConfigureFail` to "exit".

- Tar archived components would not be installed when zowe.useConfigmgr=true was set.

- Various bugfixes made for reading and writing of parmlib configuration files when using the PARMLIB() syntax with zwe commands or the ZWESLSTC job.

- Revised help documentation syntax for substitution values to fix auto-documentation, by changing angle brackets to square brackets.
