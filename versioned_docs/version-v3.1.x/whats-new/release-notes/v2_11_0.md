### Zowe Installation and Packaging

- Added `zowe.sysMessages` as a property to the `Zowe YAML` configuration file. This property is a new array that allows you to select messages that will be duplicated into the z/OS syslog, when found in Zowe’s job log. ([#93](https://github.com/zowe/launcher/pull/93))

### Zowe Application Framework

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

Swagger is now validated for registered services whereby all endpoints listed in the swagger can be called and give a documented response. This feature also checks that the API is correctly versioned. ([#3039](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3039))

## Bug fixes

Zowe Version 2.11.0 contains the bug fixes that are described in the following topics.

### Zowe Installation and Packaging

- Fixed a bug where using recent versions of `Java 8` to generate a `Zowe PKCS12 keystore` would result in an unusable keystore to `ZSS` and other z/OS software that utilizes GSK / SystemSSL. The fix uses a compatibility option in Java to revert its keystore generation behavior to prior behavior that worked for Zowe.([#3507](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/3507))

### Zowe Application Framework

- Fixed regression that prevented use of multiple certificatate authorities when specified via the `zowe.certificate.pem.certificateAuthorities` section of the `Zowe YAML` configuration file. ([#266](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/pull/266))

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

* The default value of `nonStrictVerifySslCertificatesOfServices` is now set to false. ([#3029](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3029))
* Fixed newlines and SSL error message in z/OSMF validation. ([#3024](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3024))
* Improvements have been made in z/OSMF logging in debug and error handling. ([#2998](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2998))
  
### Zowe CLI

#### Zowe CLI (Core)

- Fixed an issue in the Daemon server which prevents users on Windows with uppercase letters in their username from using the Daemon. ([#1765](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/1765))
- Added a check to the `zowe files create data-set` command to prevent users from specifying an invalid block size for sequential data sets with variable block format. ([#1439](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/1439))
- Fixed a failure with the `zowe auth logout apiml` command that occurred if the user had an invalid or expired token. A user with an invalid or expired token can use the `zowe auth logout apiml` command to remove the expired token from their secure credential storage. ([#1734](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/1734))
- Removed the need to check for basepath when the user was logging out to prevent misleading `basePath error` when credentials are invalid. ([#1734](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/1734))

#### Zowe CLI Imperative Framework

- Fixed merging of profile properties in `ProfileInfo.createSession`. ([#1008](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/1008))
- Fixed an issue to now allow a user to run the `zowe auth logout apiml` command multiple times without failing. ([#966](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/pull/996))
- Updated the `auto-init` command to prevent an unwanted second login request if the user already has a token. ([#966](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/pull/996))
