# Use cases

## What can I do using the plug-in?

The plug-in provides the ability to work with a mainframe through z/OSMF REST API. It has such functionalities as:
- Working with [z/OS data sets](./intellij-zos-files.md) and [USS Files](./intellij-uss-files.md): you can create new entities, [copy and move](./intellij-copy-cut.md) them, delete, edit right in the IDE, check and change properties
- Working with [JES jobs](./intellij-jes-explorer.md): you can submit a job, see an output of any job, edit and run JCL right through the JES Explorer, see and change the status of a job
- Working with [TSO](./intellij-tso-cli.md): you can submit any TSO command through the plug-in's TSO Command Line Interface in a console way, see the output of TSO commands

## Who is the plugin intended for?

The plug-in is suitable for your needs if you meet one or more of the criteria:
- You are a **System Programmer** and use **COBOL** / **JCL** / **PLI/I**: with the plug-in, you can easily change the source code, situated on a mainframe, right in the IDE's editor, without the risk of exposing your data anywhere, as all the content is stored under and displayed from the secure IntelliJ's storage. With a bunch of available plug-ins, it will provide the most of opportunities to work with your programs, written on mainframe-specific languages
- You are a **System Administrator** / **System Operator**: the plug-in's **TSO CLI** provides the way of interacting with a mainframe the same as the other tools do, extending the User Experience to the highest possible peak
- You are a **QA** / **Test Automation** person: it gives as much possibilities to check the actual content of a mainframe as the most modern technologies do, reducing latencies in any interaction with the components of the system
- You are a **Java** / **Kotlin** / **Scala** developer: IntelliJ IDEA provides native support for **JVM languages**, so it is more suitable for these technologies to develop for a mainframe
