# Editing team configurations

After you [initialize team configuration](../user-guide/cli-using-initializing-team-configuration), the newly created team profiles need additional details before they can be shared and applied in your environment. This could include information such as a port number or user credentials.

You might also need to modify the configuration file to [create new profiles](../user-guide/cli-using-creating-profiles.md) for accessing mainframe services.

## Adding, modifying team profiles

To define additional mainframe services and other profiles in an existing global team configuration file:

1. Open the `~/.zowe/zowe.config.json` file in a text editor or an IDE (such as Visual Studio Code) on your computer.

2. Edit the file by adding to or modifying the profiles listed in the profiles object.

    Each profile contains connection and other frequently needed information for accessing various mainframe services, as in the following example:

    ```
    {
        "$schema": "./zowe.schema.json",
        "profiles": {
            "zosmf": {
                "type": "zosmf",
                "properties": {
                    "port": 443
                }
            },
            "global_base": {
                "type": "base",
                "properties": {
                    "host": "example1.com"
                },
                "secure": [
                    "user",
                    "password"
                ]
            }
        },
        "defaults": {
            "zosmf": "zosmf",
            "base": "global_base"
        },
    }
    ```

## Available service profile types

A profile contains all, or most, of the information you need to connect to a specific mainframe service. Your configuration can have multiple profiles, and these can consist of different profile *types* and even different *kinds* of a particular profile type, depending on the connection information.

There are three basic profile types:

- service profiles
- base profiles
- parent profiles

You can learn more about how service, base, and parent profiles work in [Zowe CLI profile types](../user-guide/cli-using-using-team-profiles.md#zowe-cli-profile-types).

### Core z/OS service profiles

The three z/OS services that Zowe CLI and Zowe Explorer profiles connect to:

- **z/OSMF** profiles connect with the IBM z/OS Management Facility service.
- **TSO** profiles connect with the Time Sharing Option service.
- **SSH** profiles connect with the Secure Shell service.

### Zowe CLI plug-in service profiles

Other kinds of *service profiles* can be used to configure connections for Zowe CLI plug-ins. A *base profile*, on the other hand, contains connection data that can be shared across multiple service profiles.

To determine the types of plug-in service profiles that can be used in Zowe CLI configuration, refer to the tables on this page or check the Zowe CLI plug-in command groups listed in the [Zowe web help](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/web_help/index.html). Most group names match the plug-in profile name.

## Profile properties

Every profile in a configuration file includes specific information, such as properties and their values, to communicate with its respective mainframe service. The values for properties are defined by your specific connection information.

The available properties for z/OS services and Zowe-conformant plug-ins profiles are listed in the following tables:

The percent sign can be used anywhere in the name. However, the source and target characters must match exactly. <br/>   <br/> Hyphen or dash (-) indicates that any character can occupy that position, but a character must exist at that position, and the source and target character must match exactly. The hyphen can be repeated in several places in the name. <br/>   <br/> Asterisk (*) indicates matching values. An asterisk cannot be used with other characters. <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/> Use a semicolon to separate mask specifications. Multiple mask specifications for the same object type are supported. <br/>  <br/> Example: <br/> The following example demonstrates different ways of matching the table MYNAME.MYTABLE to the table YOURNAME.YOURTABLE: <br/>   <br/> TABLE MY%.%TABLE YOUR%.%TABLE;  <br/> TABLE MYN-M-.MYT% YOURN-M-.YOURT%; <br/> TABLE MYNAME.MYTABLE YOURNAME.YOURTABLE;  <br/> TABLE *.MYTABLE *.YOURTABLE; <br/>  <br/> For a list of mask specifications, see the [RC/Migrator documentation](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/db2rcmig). <br/>  <br/> Note: <br/> - If `--match-set` and `--match-set-file` are both specified, specifications in match-set-file take precedence. <br/> - The matchSetValues options-profile option has the same behavior as the match-set-file command option.  | array |
| modification | Specifies a named set of server-managed default parameter values that control the execution behavior of the zowe dbm-db2 commands.
