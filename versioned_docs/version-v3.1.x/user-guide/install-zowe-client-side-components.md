To prepare for an installation or upgrade, your installation team should review the configuration requirements for both z/OSMF and the particular component to be installed.

Doing so can help you complete the process faster without any delays due to missing pre-requisites that may require a system administrator to configure.

To install your product, we recommend that your team understands the following topics:

- JCL
- TSO/ISPF
- Your organization's IT environment, enterprise structure, and region structure
- z/OS environment and installing software in this environment
- z/OS UNIX System Services

Consult with the following team roles, as required:
- Security administrator for access
- Storage administrator for DASD allocations
- Systems programmer for z/OS and VTAM definitions
