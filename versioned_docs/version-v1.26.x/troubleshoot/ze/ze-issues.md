# Raising a Zowe Explorer issue on GitHub

You can raise GitHub issues against [the Zowe Explorer repository](https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/issues). It is suggested that you use either the bug or feature request.

## Raising a bug report

Please provide as much of the information listed on [Troubleshooting Zowe Explorer](troubleshoot-ze.md) as is reasonable. Anyone working on the issue might need to request this and other information if it is not supplied initially. A description of the error and how it can be reproduced is the most important information.

## Submitting a feature request

Feature requests are just as important to the Zowe project as bug reports. Feature requests should contain clearly formulated ideas that can improve user experience.
