# Checking your Zowe version release number

Once Zowe is installed and running, you will likely update Zowe and Zowe plug-ins regularly as new major and minor releases come out.

To keep track of which release is running as you troubleshoot an issue, the commands and file listed here can help.

## Server side

To see the version of a Zowe release, run the `zwe version` command in USS:

```shell
zwe version
```

The `zwe version` command returns a single line with the Zowe release number:
```
Zowe v2.0.0
```
### Using other commands

Add the `debug` or `trace` options to the `zwe version` command to show more information.

Using the `debug` mode:

```
zwe version --debug
Zowe v2.9.0
build and hash: v2.x/master#3248 (77fe6c5277e52474ebe9258c1b745949537dc398)
```
The `debug` mode shows the unique build identifier for the installed version of Zowe. Run this when you want to replicate a bug for testing or troubleshooting.

Using the `trace` mode:
```
zwe version --trace
Zowe v2.9.0
build and hash: v2.x/master#3248 (77fe6c5277e52474ebe9258c1b745949537dc398)
Zowe directory: /SYSTEM/zowe/runtime
```
The `trace` mode  shows the location where the convenience build was extracted (such as `<RUNTIME_DIR>`). Run this when you want to confirm the location of your Zowe runtime directory.

### Using the `manifest` file

Find the version number of your Zowe release in the `manifest.json` file.

1. Extract the PAX file for the [Zowe convenience build](../user-guide/install-zowe-zos-convenience-build.md) to `<RUNTIME_DIR>`.
2. Navigate to `<RUNTIME_DIR>` to locate the `manifest.json` file.
3. Open the `manifest.json` file.
    
    The Zowe version is listed at the beginning of the file:
    ```
    {
    "name": "Zowe",
    "version": "2.10.0",
    "description": "Zowe is an open source project ...
    ```
