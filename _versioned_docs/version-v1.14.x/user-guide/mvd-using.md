# Using the Zowe Desktop

You can use the Zowe&trade; Application Framework to create application plug-ins for the Zowe Desktop. For more information, see [Extending the Zowe Application Framework](../extend/extend-desktop/mvd-extendingzlux.md). 

## Navigating the Zowe Desktop

From the Zowe Desktop, you can access Zowe applications. 

### Accessing the Zowe Desktop

From a supported browser, open the Zowe Desktop at `https://{myhost}:{httpsPort}` or you can navigate to the direct Desktop URI at `https://{myhost}:{httpsPort}/ZLUX/plugins/org.zowe.zlux.bootstrap/web/index.html`
    
Where:

-   *myHost* is the host on which you are running the Zowe Application Server.
-   *httpsPort* is the value that was assigned to *node.https.port* in `zluxserver.json`.
    For example, if you run the Zowe Application Server on host *myhost* and the value that is assigned to *node.https.port* in `zluxserver.json` is 12345, you would specify `https://myhost:12345/ZLUX/plugins/org.zowe.zlux.bootstrap/web/index.html`.


### Logging in and out of the Zowe Desktop

1. To log in, enter your mainframe credentials in the **Username** and  **Password** fields.
2. Press Enter. Upon authentication of your user name and password, the desktop opens.

To log out, click the User icon in the lower right corner and click **Sign Out**.

4. When you are prompted, restart Zowe.

## Zowe Desktop application plug-ins

Application plug-ins are applications that you can use to access the mainframe and to perform various tasks. Developers can create application plug-ins using a sample application as a guide. The following application plug-ins are installed by default:

### Hello World Sample
The Hello World sample application plug-in for developers demonstrates how to create a dataservice and how to create an application plug-in using Angular.

### IFrame Sample
The IFrame sample application plug-in for developers demonstrates how to embed pre-made webpages within the desktop as an application and how an application can request an action of another application (see the source code for more information).

### z/OS Subsystems
The z/OS Subsystems plug-in helps you find information about the important services on the mainframe, such as CICS, Db2, and IMS.

### 3270 Terminal
The 3270 Terminal plug-in provides a user interface that emulates the basic functions of IBM 3270 family terminals. On the "back end," the plug-in and the Zowe Application Server connect to any standard TN3270E server.

### VT Terminal 
The VT Terminal plug-in provides a user interface that emulates the basic functions of DEC VT family terminals. On the "back end," the plug-in and the Zowe Application Server connect to VT compatible hosts, such as z/OS UNIX System Services (USS), using standard network protocols.

### API Catalog
The API Catalog plug-in lets you view API services that have been discovered by the API Mediation Layer. For more information about the API Mediation Layer, Discovery Service, and API Catalog, see [API Mediation Layer Overview](../getting-started/overview.md).

### Editor
With the Zowe Editor you can create and edit files and view datasets on the system that Zowe serves.

### Workflows
From the Workflows application plug-in you can create, manage, and use z/OSMF workflows to manage your system.

### JES Explorer
Use this application to query JES jobs with filters, and view the related steps, files, and status. You can also purge jobs from this view.

### MVS Explorer
Use this application to browse the MVSâ„¢ file system by using a high-level qualifier filter. With the MVS Explorer, you can complete the following tasks:

  - List the members of partitioned data sets.
  - Create new data sets using attributes or the attributes of an existing data set ("Allocate Like").
  - Submit data sets that contain JCL to Job Entry Subsystem (JES).
  - Edit sequential data sets and partitioned data set members with basic syntax highlighting and content assist for JCL and REXX.
  - Conduct basic validation of record length when editing JCL.
  - Delete data sets and members.
  - Open data sets in full screen editor mode, which gives you a fully qualified link to that file. The link is then reusable for example in help tickets.

### USS Explorer

  Use this application to browse the USS files by using a path. With the USS Explorer, you can complete the following tasks:

 - List files and folders.
 - Create new files and folders.
 - Edit files with basic syntax highlighting and content assist for JCL and REXX.
 - Delete files and folders.

## Using the Workflows application plug-in
