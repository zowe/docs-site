# Troubleshooting installation and startup of Zowe z/OS components

The following topics contain information that can help you troubleshoot problems when you encounter unexpected behavior installing Zowe z/OS components or starting Zowe's `ZWESVSTC` started task.


## How to check if `ZWESVSTC` startup is successful 

The `ZWESVSTC` started task on z/OS brings up a number of address spaces.  There is no single **Zowe has launched and is ready to run** message as the sequence of address spaces initialization is environment-dependent, although the message ID `ZWED0021I` is typically the last one that is logged.  More details on each subsystem and their startup messages are described in the following sections.

- [Check the startup of API Mediation Layer](#check-the-startup-of-api-mediation-layer)
- [Check the startup of Zowe Desktop](#check-the-startup-of-zowe-desktop)
- [Check the startup of Zowe File and Jobs API servers](#check-the-startup-of-zowe-file-and-jobs-api-servers)
- [Check the startup of Zowe Secure Services](#check-the-startup-of-zowe-secure-services)
    
To check that Zowe has started successfully, the most complete way is to check that each component successfully completed its initialization. Each component writes messages to the JES `STDOUT` and writes severe errors to the `STDERR` job spool file.  

To learn more about the Zowe components and their role, see [Zowe Architecture](../getting-started/zowe-architecture.md). It is possible to configure Zowe to bring up only a subset of its components by using the `LAUNCH_COMPONENT_GROUPS` variable in the `instance.env` file. See [Component Groups](../user-guide/configure-instance-directory.md#component-groups) for more information.  

To monitor `ZWESVSTC` to check whether each component has launched successfully, you can use one of the following ways: 
- A good approach is to look at the active address spaces by using a command such as `DA` in SDSF. Each address space is named to identify its component, see [Address space names](../user-guide/configure-instance-directory.md#address-space-names).
- You can also look for particular messages in the `STDOUT` Job spool file.

### Check the startup of API Mediation Layer 

The API Mediation Layer has three address spaces: API Catalog `ZWE1AC`, API Gateway `ZWE1AG`, and API Discovery `ZWE1AD`.  These might have been changed from their defaults. For more information, see [Address space names](../user-guide/configure-instance-directory.md#address-space-names). 

To check whether the API mediation layer is fully initialized, you can look for the `ZWEAM000I` message. Each component writes a successful startup message `ZWEAM000I` to the JES as shown below. The message also indicates the CPU of seconds spent. Check that each address space has written this message.

```
021-01-12 17:48:23.738 <ZWEADS1:main:33557015> ZWESVUSR INFO  (o.z.a.p.s.ServiceStartupEventHandler) `ZWEAM000I` Discovery Service started in 97.725 seconds
...
2021-01-12 17:48:30.145 <ZWEAGW1:main:50334212> ZWESVUSR INFO  (o.z.a.p.s.ServiceStartupEventHandler) `ZWEAM000I` Gateway Service started in 104.248 seconds
...
2021-01-12 17:48:31.036 <ZWEAAC1:main:33557009> ZWESVUSR INFO  (o.z.a.p.s.ServiceStartupEventHandler) `ZWEAM000I` API Catalog Service started in 105.127 seconds
```

As well as looking for `ZWEAM00I` in the JES log, you can also log in to the gateway homepage and check the service status indicator.  If there is a red or yellow tick beside one of its three services, the components are still starting.

When all services are fully initialized, there will be three green ticks.

### Check the startup of Zowe Desktop 

The Zowe Desktop address space is named `ZWE1DS1`. During its initialization process, the desktop loads its plug-ins and writes a message `ZWED0031I` when it is completed.  

```
2021-01-22 14:35:00.300 <ZWED:16842882> ZWESVUSR INFO (_zsf.install,index.js:340) ZWED0031I - Server is ready at https://0.0.0.0:8554, Plugins successfully loaded: 100% (21/21)
```

The `ZWED0031I` message includes a count of the number of loaded plug-ins as well as the total number of plug-ins, for example `Plugins successfully loaded: 100% (21/21)`.  A failed plug-in load will not abort the launch of the desktop.

In the preceding message example, it indicates that 21 plug-ins have loaded successfully. Each of these plug-ins writes its individual message `ZWED0290I`, so `ZWED0031I` indicates 21 plug-ins have loaded and there will be 21 instances of `ZWED0290I`, for example:

```
2021-01-22 14:34:58.762 <ZWED:16842882> ZWESVUSR INFO (_zsf.install,index.js:263) ZWED0290I - Plugin (org.zowe.zosmf.workflows) loaded. Successful: 5% (1/21) Attempted: 5% (1/21)
...
2021-01-22 14:35:00.114 <ZWED:16842882> ZWESVUSR INFO (_zsf.install,index.js:263) ZWED0290I - Plugin (org.zowe.zlux.appmanager.app.propview) loaded. Successful: 52% (11/21) Attempted: 52% (11/21)
...
2021-01-22 14:35:00.278 <ZWED:16842882> ZWESVUSR INFO (_zsf.install,index.js:263) ZWED0290I - Plugin (org.zowe.api.catalog) loaded. Successful: 95% (20/21) Attempted: 95% (20/21)
```

Messages for `ZWED0290I` will be written when the JES Explorer `org.zowe.explorer-jes`, the MVS Explorer `org.zowe.explorer-mvs`, and the USS Explorer `org.zowe.explorer-uss` are loaded. 

When the Zowe desktop and the API Gateway are both started in a launch configuration, it will register itself with the API Gateway after the Zowe desktop has started. This step must be completed before a user is able to successfully log in, as the API Mediation layer is used as the backing authentication service.  The message that is written to indicate that the registration has been successful is `ZWED0021I`, for example

```2021-01-22 14:36:01.846 <ZWED:16842882> ZWESVUSR INFO (_zsf.apiml,apiml.js:218) ZWED0021I - Eureka Client Registered from 127.0.0.1. Available at https://<HOSTNAME>:<APIDISCOVERYPORT>/ui/v1/zlux/
```

If you try to log into the Zowe desktop too early before the Eureka client registration has occurred you may get an **Authentication failed** message on the login page because the APIML handshake is incomplete.  If this occurs wait for the registration to be complete as indiciated by the `ZWED0021I` message.

### Check the startup of Zowe File and Jobs API servers

Zowe has two servers that are used to provide API services for jobs and files. The Jobs API server address space is named `ZWE1EF` and the Files API server address space is named `ZWE1EJ`.  When these have successfully started, a message `Started <name> in <nn> seconds (JVM running for <nn>)` is written to the log, for example:

```
2021-01-22 14:35:17.869 <ZWEEAJ1:main:50397279> ZWESVUSR INFO  (o.z.j.JesJobsApplication,StartupInfoLogger.java:59) Started JesJobsApplication in 29.867 seconds (JVM running for 37.296)
...
2021-01-22 14:35:21.567 <ZWEEAD1:main:67174496> ZWESVUSR INFO  (o.z.DataSetsAndUnixFilesApplication,StartupInfoLogger.java:59) Started DataSetsAndUnixFilesApplication in 33.597 seconds (JVM running for 41.002)
```

### Check the startup of Zowe Secure Services

The zssServer is used for secure services for the Zowe desktop.  

```
ZWES1013I ZSS Server has started. Version '1.18.0+20201214' 
```

The zssServer will register itself with the cross memory server running under the address space `ZWESISTC`.  You can use the attach message ID `ZWES1014I` to check that this has occurred successfully.  If this message contains a nonzero return code in the `cmsRC=` value, then a failure occurred. For more information on how to diagnose these, see [ZSS server unable to communicate with X-MEM](./app-framework/app-troubleshoot.md#zss-server-unable-to-communicate-with-x-mem).

```
ZWES1014I ZIS status - 'Ok' (name='ZWESIS_STD      ', cmsRC='0', description='Ok', clientVersion='2')
```

## Unable to launch Zowe with { FSUM7351 }

When you run `zowe-start.sh` from a unix shell path `<zowe-instance-directory>/bin`, you encounter the following error:

```
<RUNTIME_DIRECTORY>/scripts/internal/opercmd: ./zowe-start.sh 6: FSUM7351 not found
```

This can be because the value of `ROOT_DIR` in the `<zowe-instance-directory>/instance.env` file is pointing to an invalid Zowe runtime.  This can occur in scenarios where the Zowe runtime directory was removed during an upgrade of a convenience build, and the `instance.env` file's `ROOT_DIR` value was not updated to point to the new fully qualified path for the new Zowe runtime.

This errors can also occur if the user ID running `zowe-start.sh` does not have read and traverse access to the directory tree ancestors of the `ROOT_DIR` itself.  For example, if `ROOT_DIR` is set to `/usr/lpp/zowe` then the TSO user executing `zowe-start.sh` must have `rx` access to the directories `usr/lpp/zowe`, `usr/lpp` and `usr`.  To see the access for a directory issue the unix command `ls -alT`.  If you do not wish to open up `rx` access to the directory tree ancestors of the `ROOT_DIR` then Zowe can still be launched using a TSO command, see [Starting Zowe with a /S TSO command](../user-guide/configure-zowe-server.md#option-2-starting-zowe-with-a-s-tso-command). 

## Unable to create BPXAS instances

**Symptom:**

When you start `ZWESVSTC` started task, either by running the `zowe-start.sh` script or by launching the started task directly, you encounter the following error in the log:

```
<ROOT_DIR>/bin/internal/run-zowe.sh 1: FSUM7726 cannot fork: reason code  = 094500f7: EDC5112I Resource temporarily unavailable.
```

You will also encounter the following messages in the SYSLOG:

```
0290  S ZWESVSTC                                                               
0281  $HASP100 ZWESVSTC ON STCINRDR

0290  BPXP005I A FORK OR SPAWN ERROR WAS ENCOUNTERED.  RETURN CODE 00000070    
      REASON CODE 094500F7                                                     
0090  IEA602I ADDRESS SPACE CREATE FAILED.  MAXUSERS WOULD HAVE BEEN EXCEEDED  
0090  IEA602I ADDRESS SPACE CREATE FAILED.  MAXUSERS WOULD HAVE BEEN EXCEEDED  
0090  IEA602I ADDRESS SPACE CREATE FAILED.  MAXUSERS WOULD HAVE BEEN EXCEEDED  
```

**Solution:**

This problem occurs when the maximum number of `BPXAS` instances have been reached.  

This may be because when the Zowe instance directory was created, it was generated in the same location as the Zowe root directory.  The Zowe instance directory is created by using the script `<RUNTIME_DIR>/bin/zowe-configure-instance.sh -c <PATH_TO_INSTANCE_DIR>`. See [Creating an instance directory](../user-guide/configure-instance-directory#creating-an-instance-directory). The Zowe runtime directory is replaced when new PTFs are applied and should be considered as a read-only set of files. Zowe instance directories are designed to live outside the directory structure and are used to start a Zowe runtime.  

This problem will only occur with Zowe drivers prior to v1.10 and has been resolved in v1.10 where the `zowe-configure-instance.sh` script will report error if it detects the `-c` argument because the installation directory location is an existing Zowe runtime directory.  

## Errors caused when running the Zowe desktop with node 8.16.1

**Symptom:**

When you start the `ZWESVSTC` started task, you encounter the following error messages: 

```
/usr/lpp/zowe/components/app-server/share/zlux-app-server/lib/initInstance.js:1
(function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token

    at bootstrap_node.js:625:3
```

```
/global/zowe/instances/prod/bin/internal/run-zowe.sh 3: FSUM7332 syntax error: got ), expecting Newline
```

**Solution:**

This problem occurs when you use Node.js v8.16.1 which is not supported on Zowe. There is a known issue with node.js v8.16.1 and Zowe desktop encoding. Use a supported version of Node.js instead. For more information, see [Supported Node.js versions](../user-guide/install-nodejs-zos.md#supported-nodejs-versions).

## Cannot start Zowe and UNIX commands not found with FSUM7351

**Symptom:**

When you start the ZWESVSTC started task, you might encounter the following error message: 

```
dirname: <instance-dir>/bin/internal/run-zowe.sh 2: FSUM7351 not found
pwd: <instance-dir>/bin/internal/run-zowe.sh 2: FSUM7351 not found
.: <instance-dir>/bin/internal/run-zowe.sh 3: /bin/internal/read-instance.sh: not found
```

**Solution:**

Check that /bin is part on your PATH. Do `echo $PATH` to check. If it is missing, make sure that it is appended to PATH in your profile, for example, in `/etc/profile/`.

## Various warnings show when connecting Zowe with another domain

**Symptoms:**

When you configure the Zowe environment variable `ZOWE_EXPLORER_HOST` in `instance.env` with a domain (for example, `domain-a.com`), and access Zowe with another domain (for example, `domain-b.com`), you may see the following errors:

- Certificate warnings similar to the following one:
  ```
  domain-b.com:8544 uses an invalid security certificate.

  The certificate is only valid for the following names: domain-a.com, <ip-of-domain-a>, localhost.localdomain, localhost, 127.0.0.1
  ```
- No pinned applications show in Zowe Desktop.
- JES Explorer, MVS Explorer, USS Explorer may show errors similar to the following one if you ignore the certificate error.
  ``` 
  Blocked by Content Security Policy

  An error occurred during a connection to domain-a.com:7554.

  Firefox prevented this page from loading in this way because the page has a content security policy that disallows it.
  ```
  

The above warnings and errors will also show when you plan to use Zowe with multiple domain names.

**Solutions:**

You can take the following steps:

- When you prepare the `bin/zowe-setup-certificates.env` file, specify the `HOSTNAME=` and `IPADDRESS=` parameters to accept multiple domains separated by comma (from Zowe v1.14.0). The following configuration is an example:

  ```
  HOSTNAME=domain-a.com,domain-b.com
  IPADDRESS=<ip-of-domain-a>,<ip-of-domain-b>
  ```

  Then you can proceed to run the `bin/zowe-setup-certificates.sh` script.
- After you run the `bin/zowe-configure-instance.sh` script, modify the `instance.env` file located in the instance directory in the following ways to reflect the multiple domains you plan to use.
  * Add a line of `ZWE_EXTERNAL_HOSTS`. For example, `ZWE_EXTERNAL_HOSTS=domain-a.com,domain-b.com`.
  * Add a line of `ZWE_REFERRER_HOSTS`. For example, `ZWE_REFERRER_HOSTS=domain-a.com,domain-b.com`.
  * Find the line that starts with `ZOWE_EXPLORER_FRAME_ANCESTORS` and modify its values to `ZOWE_EXPLORER_FRAME_ANCESTORS="${ZOWE_EXPLORER_HOST}:*,domain-a.com:*,domain-b.com:*,${ZOWE_IP_ADDRESS}:*"`.

**Drawback:**

With this change, you must use the API Mediation Layer Gateway port (default is 7554) to access Zowe Desktop, for example, `https://domain-a.com:7554/ui/v1/zlux` or `https://domain-b.com:7554/ui/v1/zlux`. Using Desktop port (default is 8544) like `https://domain-b.com:8544/` is not supported.
