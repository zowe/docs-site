## Collecting data for Zowe problems

Sometimes you cannot solve a problem by troubleshooting the symptoms. In such cases, you must collect diagnostic data. To collect diagnostic data about Zowe, see [Capturing diagnostics to assist problem determination](troubleshoot-diagnostics.md).

## Verifying a Zowe release's integrity

Following a successful install of a Zowe release, the Zowe runtime directory should contain the code needed to launch and run Zowe. If the contents of the Zowe runtime directory have been modified then this may result in unpredictable behavior. To assist with this Zowe provides the ability to validate the integrity of a Zowe runtime directory, see [Verify Zowe runtime directory](./verify-fingerprint.md)

## Understanding the Zowe release

Knowing which version of Zowe you are running might help you isolate the problem. Also, the Zowe community who helps you will need to know this information. For more information, see [Understanding the Zowe release](troubleshoot-zowe-release.md).
