<!--Thank you for deciding to add a troubleshooting tip to the documentation. Before you create the issue, you can review the existing [Troubleshooting tips](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/troubleshoot/troubleshooting.html) to check if the issue and solution has already been documented. If not, provide the following information to help the content team understand and document the tip. -->

### 1. Slack conversation link (if any)

<!--Provide a link to the troubleshooting conversation on Slack if any. For example, https://ibm-systems-z.slack.com/archives/CA2PBRTEH/p1585547402007900-->

### 2. Choose a title

<!--Name it after the problem you're trying to solve, using the terms users are likely to type into the search . For example, `Cannot log in to the Zowe Desktop`, `npm install -g command fails due to an EPERM error`.-->

### 3. Symptom

<!--Describe the problem and symptom as other people would experience it. For example, `When you open apps in the desktop, a page is displayed with the message "The plugin failed to load." `-->

### 4. Solution

<!--Describe the possible causes and how to fix the problem. Add screenshots, illustrations as necessary.-->
