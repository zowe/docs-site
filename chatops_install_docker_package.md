# Installing Zowe Chat with Container image

Container is introduced to reduce the time and effort in installing Zowe Chat in this section.

To simplify the installation, an Zowe Chat Container image is provided as an alternative to the native installation package. With the Container image, you can create an Zowe Chat container that includes most elements that are needed for Zowe Chat to run, including Node.js, and Zowe Chat itself.
