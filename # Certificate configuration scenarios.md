# Certificate configuration scenarios

There are five scenarios/use cases for configuring certificates.
Use the applicable certificate configuration scenario according to your needs.

* [Scenario 1: Use a PKCS12 (keystore) with Zowe generated certificates](#scenario-1-use-a-pkcs12-keystore-with-zowe-generated-certificates)
* [Scenario 2: Use a PKCS12 (keystore) and import a certificate generated by another CA](#scenario-2-use-a-pkcs12-keystore-and-import-a-certificate-generated-by-another-ca)
* [Scenario 3: Use a z/OS Keyring with Zowe generated certificates](#scenario-3-use-a-zos-keyring-with-zowe-generated-certificates)
* [Scenario 4: Use a z/OS Keyring and connect to an existing certificate](#scenario-4-use-a-zos-keyring-and-connect-to-an-existing-certificate)
* [Scenario 5: Use a z/OS Keyring and import a certificate stored in a data set](#scenario-5-use-a-zos-keyring-and-import-a-certificate-stored-in-a-data-set)

## Scenario 1: Use a PKCS12 (keystore) with Zowe generated certificates

1. Select the type of certificate storage with `type: PKCS12`  
Possible values include the following values:  

    * PKCS12  
    * JCEKS  
    * JCECCAKS  
    * JCERACFKS  
    * JCECCARACFKS  
    * JCEHYBRIDRACFKS

2. Customize the keystore directory in the following format:
    ```
    /var/zowe/keystore
    ```
3. Lock the keystore directory so it is accessible only to the Zowe runtime user and group:
    ```
    lock: true
    ```
4. Customize the certificate alias name. The default value is `localhost`.  
    **Note:** Use all lower case as an alias.
5. Set keystore password. Customizing this value is highly recommended. The default value is `password`.
6. Set the alias name of self-signed certificate authority. The default value is `local_ca`.  
   **Note:** Use all lower case as an alias.
   ```
   caAlias: local_ca
   ```
7. Set the password of the keystore stored self-signed certificate authority. The default value is `local_ca_password`.
    ```
    caPassword: local_ca_password
    ```
8. (Optional) Specify the distinguished name for Zowe generated certificates. 

    ```
    dname:
      caCommonName: ""
      commonName: ""
      orgUnit: ""
      org: ""
      locality: ""
      state: ""
      country: ""
    ```
9. Set the validity in days for the Zowe generated certificates
    ```  
    validity: 3650
    ```
10. Set the domain names and IPs specified in nested subsection `SAN`. If this field is not defined, the `zwe init` command uses the value `zowe.externalDomains`.
    ```
    san:
        sample domain name
        - dvipa.my-company.com
        sample IP address
        - 12.34.56.78
     ```

## Scenario 2: Use a PKCS12 (keystore) and import a certificate generated by another CA

1. Select the type of certificate storage with `type: PKCS12`  
Possible values include the following values:    

    * PKCS12  
    * JCEKS  
    * JCECCAKS  
    * JCERACFKS  
    * JCECCARACFKS  
    * JCEHYBRIDRACFKS

2. Customize the keystore directory in the following format:
    ```
    /var/zowe/keystore
    ```
3. Lock the keystore directory so it is accessible only to the Zowe runtime user and group:
    ```
    lock: true
    ```
4. Customize the certificate alias name. The default value is `localhost`.  
    **Note:** Use all lower case as an alias.
5. Set keystore password. The default value is `password`.
6. Set the existing PKCS12 keystore which holds the certificate issued by an external CA.  
    ```
    keystore: ""  
    ```
7. Set the password of the keystore set in step 6.  
    ```
    password: ""
    ```
8. Specify the alias of the certificate to be imported.
    ```
    alias: ""
    ```  
    **Note:** Use all lower cases as an alias.    
    
9. Set the path to the certificate authority that signed the certificate to be imported.
    ```
    importCertificateAuthorities:
    ```
    **Note:** PEM format certificate authorities can be imported and trusted.

##  Scenario 3: Use a z/OS Keyring with Zowe generated certificates

1. Select the type of certificate storage with `type: JCERACFKS`  
Possible values include the following values:  

    * PKCS12  
    * JCEKS  
    * JCECCAKS  
    * JCERACFKS  
    * JCECCARACFKS  
    * JCEHYBRIDRACFKS

2. Add the parameter `createZosmfTrust` and set to true.  
    ```
    createZosmfTrust: true
    ```
3. Under the nested subsection `keyring:`, specify the following keyring values:  

    * keyring name  
        ```
        name: ZoweKeyring
        ```
    * Label of Zowe certificate. The default value is `localhost`.  
        ```
        label: localhost
        ```
    * Label of Zowe CA certificate. The default value is `localca`.
        ```
        caLabel: localca
        ```
    * The distinguished name for Zowe generated certificates.  
        ```
        dname:
            caCommonName: ""
            commonName: ""
            orgUnit: ""
            org: ""
            locality: ""
            state: ""
            country: ""
        ```
4. Set the validity in days for the Zowe generated certificates
    ```  
    validity: 3650
    ```
5. Set the domain names and IPs specified in the certificate SAN. If 
this field is not defined, the `zwe init` command uses the value `zowe.externalDomains`.  
    ```
    san:
      - dvipa.my-company.com
      - 12.34.56.78
    ```
    **Note**: Due to the limitation of the `RACDCERT` command, this field should contain exactly 2 entries with the domain name and IP address.

## Scenario 4: Use a z/OS Keyring and connect to an existing certificate

1. Select the type of certificate storage with `type: JCERACFKS`  
Possible values include the following values:  
    * PKCS12  
    * JCEKS  
    * JCECCAKS  
    * JCERACFKS  
    * JCECCARACFKS  
    * JCEHYBRIDRACFKS

    ```
3. Under the nested subsection `connect:`, specify the following parameters:  
    * The current owner of the certificate. Possible values can be `SITE` or a user ID.
        ```
        user: IBMUSER
        ```
    * The label of the existing certificate to be connected to the Zowe keyring.  
        ```
        label: ""
        ```
    * All certificate authorities you want to be trusted in the Zowe keyring.
        ```
        importCertificateAuthorities:
          - ""
        ```
        **Note:** Due to the limitation of `RACDCERT` command, this field should contain a maximum of 2 entries.
